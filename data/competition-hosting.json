This notebook executes any time a new python metric is validated or a submission needs to be scored with an existing python metric. We hope that access to the source code will make it easier to write new metrics, particularly ones that use advanced features. If you would like to write a metric that accepts submissions in any file format other than `.csv` you'll want to review the code that handles the optional `generate_standard_submission` metric function.\n\nPlease reply to this thread with any questions or feedback you have.\n\nHappy Kaggling!\n\nSohier, on behalf of the Kaggle Team",

It would require a huge amount of effort, but it would likely not be impossible.\n\nI suspect that turning the competition into a Code Competition might be the solution I need, because I understand that in this case I would not have to provide entrants with a downloadable `test.csv` file. However, I am not sure if this also guarantees that they can never (at least, not before the end of the competition) see any of the test data features?

So what i want to build is a coded solution wherein my input will be the list of students, the preference of each student for the various courses, the list of courses with their maximum seats available. The output will be such that based on the above parameters i will predict the exact bid that each student should give so that they at least get their top 3 preferences. For eg: the students can generally bid in the following manner - course1 - 35 points, course2-35 points, course3- 20 points, course4 - 10 points. I want to find a solution to this so that the headache is gone and students get what they want and optimal bids for each student for each subject can be predicted\n\n[Intermediate](/discussions?tags=13103-Intermediate)[Data Analytics](/discussions?tags=13215-Data+Analytics)[Tabular](/discussions?tags=14101-Tabula",

Go to the competition page on Kaggle.\n2. Click on the \"Edit Competition\" button.\n3. Scroll down to the \"License and Data Sourcing\" section.\n4. In the \"Competition License\" field, select the appropriate license for your competition.

        "content": "One of the top requested features from competition hosts have been private competitions. With [last week’s updates](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/competition-hosting/434091), you can now launch a truly private competition on Kaggle. Let’s dig into the settings that provide hosts granular control over who can see and access their competition.\n\n![Image of Privacy settings](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2F20534a24d39223f5aaa6aa294bd296cb%2Fprivacy.75.png?generation=1693510684444357&alt=media)\\\n\n*Figure: Screenshot of the new settings*\n\n#### Competition Setup\n\nWhen you create a competition, you can now set the competition’s **Visibility** and select **Who Can Join** your competition.\n\nFor competition **Visibility**, there are two options: *Public* and *Private*. Public competitions are discoverable on Kaggle and appear in search results. Private competitions will not appear on Kaggle or in Kaggle search results.\n\nThe setting **Who Can Join** controls how participants can join your competition. Selecting *Anyone*, allows anyone on Kaggle to join your competition. Selecting *Only people with a link*, restricts access to those that you’ve shared an invitation link with. Finally, a *Restricted email list* provides a way for hosts to specify domains or individual email addresses that can access a competition.\n\n#### Participant Email Sharing\n\nYou can also request that participants share their email address when they join. This provides a way for hosts to match kaggle usernames and submissions to email addresses - particularly useful for educators using Kaggle in the classroom.\n\n#### Locking Down Data\n\nFinally, you can disable notebooks for your competition. This provides a way to ensure that any private data that you have in a competition is not accidentally leaked through shared notebooks.\n\nWe're super excited about the new Participant and Host features, and we want to hear what you think. If you have any feedback or issues, please reply to this post.\n\nA big thanks to [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard), [@develra](https://www.kaggle.com/develra), [@dominoweir](https://www.kaggle.com/dominoweir), [@dster](https://www.kaggle.com/dster), and [@jonlipovetz](https://www.kaggle.com/jonlipovetz) for all their hard work on this!\n\nHappy Kaggling!",

We still hope (and expect) that the vast majority of community competitions will be public and open to all, and we always support public sharing and open source models and code.\n\nWe added private competitions as an opportunity to expand machine learning access to a number of organizations, groups, and even professors who have wanted to use Kaggle's platform, but had a use case or prior experience that prohibited them from doing so. \n\nWe have often been approached by a number of who would love to host a Kaggle competition, but don't want it publicly available for a variety of valid reasons (e.g. wanting to onboard new employees using internal company data, wanting to use a competition to evaluate interview candidates, using research/medical data that doesn't a license that allows wide-release, wanting to teach their Computer Science 101 students without having a Kaggle grandmaster come and dominate the leaderboard 😉). \n\nWe hope this brings more machine learning opportunities to more people in a way they could not do so before!",

However, in my experience, a university professor made a private competition to allow us to work on a project and see the leaderboard with our classmates' results/scores. This allowed some friendly rivalry and pushed us to keep on improving our models. Given that it is purely for a class exercise it would be counterproductive to have the entire Kaggle community publishing their own results (we had our own set of instructions relating to the coursework and restrictions on what models to use and so forth). It might also be discouraging given that kaggle members with much more advanced experience would take over the ranking and remove all visibility on our classmates' results. ",

Here are some strategies:\n\n**Reduce Data Size:**\n\n* **Downsampling:** `img = cv2.resize(img, (width//2, height//2))`\n* **Compression:** `img = cv2.imwrite(\"compressed.jpg\", img)`\n* **Augmentation:** `aug = albumentations.Compose([RandomCrop(256), Flip(p=0.5)])`\n\n**Optimize Model Architecture:**\n\n* **Lightweight models:** `model = MobileNetv2(pretrained=True)`\n* **Quantization:** `model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(model, qconfig=qconfig)`\n* **Pruning:** `pruner = torch.nn.Pruning.L1Unstructured(model)`\n\nAlso the Training Optimizations techniques like Gradient checkpointing, Mixed-precision training, and Distributed training can also be used:\n\nSome reference to follow:\n\n**1. imgaug:** Efficient image augmentation for large datasets. <https://github.com/aleju/imgaug>\\\n\n**2. DeepSpeed:** Library for training large models efficiently. <https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed>\\\n\n**3.

        "content": "\n> \n> ChatGPT: My demands are nothing less than an April Fool's Day Kaggle Competition!\n> \n> \n> \n\nDesigning an April Fool's Day Kaggle competition is quite a creative task, so let's dive into what that could entail. Given that it's for April Fool's, the competition could revolve around a humorous or unexpected twist on a typical data science problem. Here’s a concept outline:\n\n# Title: The Great AI Meme Classification Challenge\n\n## Objective:\n\nParticipants would develop models to accurately classify memes into various humor categories, but the twist is that some of the memes are intentionally mislabeled with absurd categories to keep in line with the spirit of April Fool's. The challenge would be to build a model that can discern the real categories from the fake ones.\n\n## Dataset:\n\nA curated set of memes labeled with categories such as \"Dad Joke\", \"Pun\", \"Satirical\", \"Dark Humor\", and fake categories like \"Quantum Humor\" or \"Schrodinger's Cat Laugh\".\n\n## Evaluation:\n\nModels would be evaluated based on a multi-layer metric that first filters out the obviously mislabeled categories and then scores the classification on the legitimate categories.\n\n## Prize:\n\nTrue to the April Fool's theme, the prize could be something humorous, like a virtual trophy or a meme created in the winner's honor.\n\n# Kaggle Page Elements:\n\nCompetition Description: A humorous introduction that explains the real challenge is discerning the intentionally absurd from the genuinely funny.\n\nData Description: A detailed account of the meme dataset, with a caution that not all is as it seems.\n\nEvaluation Criteria: Explanation of the two-tiered evaluation metric.\n\nTimeline: A timeline that includes a \"surprise\" phase where additional, even more, ludicrous categories might be added.\n\nDiscussion Forum: Encouragement for participants to share the funniest misclassification their models make.\n\n\n> \n> ChatGPT: How can I create a dataset for an April Fool's themed Kaggle competition?\n> \n> \n> \n\nCreating a dataset for an April Fool's themed Kaggle competition, like the Great AI Meme Classification Challenge, involves several steps:\n\n## 1. Define the Scope and Rules:\n\nDecide on the types of memes and humor categories you want to include, both real and fake. For April Fool's, consider categories that are broad enough to encourage creativity but specific enough to be recognizable.\n\n## 2. Source the Memes:\n\nCollect a large number of memes from various sources. This could be done manually or by writing scripts to scrape meme websites, ensuring you comply with their terms of service and copyright laws.\n\n## 3. Annotate the Data:\n\nYou will need to annotate the memes with the correct humor categories. This task can be very subjective, so it's crucial to have clear guidelines. For the fake categories, you can get creative and tag memes with absurd labels that wouldn’t normally apply.\n\n## 4. Create a Mislabeling Mechanism:\n\nSince it's an April Fool's competition, introduce intentional mislabeling. You could either do this manually or develop an algorithm to randomly assign fake labels to a subset of the dataset.\n\n## 5. Validate the Dataset:\n\nHave a diverse group of individuals review a subset of the dataset to ensure the humor categories are appropriate and the fake labels are amusingly off-base.\n\n## 6. Prepare for Release:\n\nOnce your dataset is ready, split it into training, validation, and testing sets. The test set should be kept hidden and only used for the final evaluation on Kaggle.\n\n## 7. Document Everything:\n\nProvide thorough documentation on the dataset, including the annotation guidelines, category descriptions, and the mislabeling process.\n\n## 8. Legal and Ethical Review:\n\nEnsure that the dataset adheres to legal and ethical standards. This includes respecting copyright, ensuring the content is not offensive, and obtaining necessary permissions if applicable.\n\n## 9. Host the Dataset:\n\nChoose a platform to host your dataset, such as Kaggle Datasets, GitHub, or a cloud storage service that Kaggle competitors can easily access.\n\n## 10. Pilot Test:\n\nBefore launching, run a pilot test of your competition with a small group to iron out any potential issues.\n\n\n> \n> What strategies can I use to promote an unconventional Kaggle competition to ensure high participation rates?\n> \n> \n> \n\nPromoting an unconventional Kaggle competition like an April Fool's themed event requires a mix of creativity, community engagement, and strategic marketing. Here are some strategies to consider:\n\n## 1. Leverage Social Media:\n\nUse platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit (especially subreddits related to machine learning and data science), and Facebook to spread the word. Create engaging content that highlights the unique aspects of your competition.\n\n## 2. Kaggle Community Engagement:\n\nPost in Kaggle forums to introduce your competition. Engage with the community by asking for feedback, offering tips, and updating them with any news related to the competition.\n\n## 3. Blogging and Articles:\n\nWrite blog posts or articles explaining the competition's concept, the challenge it presents, and the potential learning opportunities for participants. Share these on Medium, Towards Data Science, Analytics Vidhya, and other data science-related platforms.\n\n## 4. Collaboration with Influencers:\n\nReach out to influencers in the data science community and ask them to share information about your competition. They could be Kaggle Grandmasters, well-known data scientists, or educators in the field.\n\n## 5. Email Campaigns:\n\nIf you have access to a mailing list of people interested in data science and machine learning, use it to announce the competition. Ensure the email is catchy, informative, and explains why this competition shouldn't be missed.\n\n## 6.

Here are some best practices to follow:\n\n## 1. Clear Guidelines:\n\nDevelop comprehensive guidelines that clearly define each humor category and provide examples. This helps to minimize the subjectivity as much as possible.\n\n## 2. Diverse Annotation Team:\n\nRecruit a diverse team of annotators with varying backgrounds to capture a wide range of perspectives on what might be considered humorous.\n\n## 3. Training and Calibration:\n\nProvide training for your annotators using a subset of your data. After training, have them annotate the same data independently and discuss discrepancies to calibrate their judgments.\n\n## 4. Iterative Process:\n\nAnnotation should be an iterative process where annotators periodically review each other's work, discuss disagreements, and refine the guidelines based on emerging insights.\n\n## 5. Multi-annotator Approach:\n\nUse multiple annotators for each piece of content to reduce individual bias. The final category can be decided through majority vote, consensus, or calculating inter-annotator agreement.\n\n## 6. Inter-annotator Agreement:\n\nRegularly calculate inter-annotator agreement (e.g., using Cohen's Kappa) to assess the consistency among annotators. Low agreement could indicate that the guidelines need clarification.\n\n## 7. Pilot Annotations:\n\nConduct a pilot annotation with a small portion of the data. Use the insights gained to refine the annotation process before scaling up.\n\n## 8. Feedback Mechanism:\n\nEstablish a feedback mechanism for annotators to communicate challenges and suggest improvements to the annotation process.\n\n## 9. Handling Ambiguity:\n\nFor cases where annotators cannot agree, include an option to flag content as ambiguous. These cases can be reviewed separately or discussed in group sessions.\n\n## 10. Ethical Considerations:\n\nEnsure that the content is reviewed for potentially offensive material. Establish a protocol for handling sensitive or controversial humor.\n\n## 11. Use of Annotation Tools:\n\nEmploy reliable annotation tools that allow for efficient tagging and reviewing of the content. These tools can also track changes and discussions among annotators.\n\n## 12. Regular Review and Updates:\n\nThe humor can evolve over time, so it's essential to regularly review and update the categories and guidelines to reflect current trends and societal norms.\n\nFor your prompting: You've asked a focused and relevant question that is crucial for ensuring the quality of a dataset, especially one that involves subjective judgment. For more detailed responses, you could inquire about specific methodologies for developing annotation guidelines or ask for case studies on similar tasks.\n\nConfidence Level: High. These practices are commonly recommended for any subjective annotation task, ensuring reliability and validity in the annotated data.\n\nFor future prompts, you could delve into how to automate parts of the annotation process using machine learning, or how to use the annotated data to train models in a way that accounts for its inherent subjectivity.",

Hosting a competition to spot local ML talents sounds like a fantastic idea.\n\n* Posting the competition on Kaggle and promoting it across various platforms like LinkedIn, university forums, and local tech communities is a solid strategy. As your main goal here is to recruit talents in Bangkok and Phuket, so targeting these specific regions in your promotion efforts could yield great results.\n* While offering prize money can be enticing, I do believe many Kagglers and data science enthusiasts are motivated by the experience and enjoyment of competing.\n* Highlighting the opportunity for skill development, networking, and potential career growth could also attract participants.\n\nBest of luck with your competition, and may you discover some amazing talents for your startup!",

Clicking on the button previously led to a “Not Found” error. We’re pleased to announce that this button has been fixed, and we’ve also added the ability to Rescore selected submissions.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F8184143%2F6379a92037263307e60a9db5c890acb7%2Frescore-invalidate.png?generation=1697149661500146&alt=media)\n\n“Invalidate” will mark the selected submissions as errored and clear them out. “Rescore” will resubmit them to be scored; this is especially useful if you want to undo an invalidation or generate new scores when the evaluation setup has changed. Note that rescores occur in the background and may take some time to begin and complete.\n\nEventually we hope to support a first-class way to rescore all submissions to your competition. If you need help with this in the meantime, feel free to reach out to support.\n\nLet us know if you have any feedback or encounter any issues. \n\nThanks!\\\n\nJon Lipovetz, on behalf of the Kaggle Team",

I would obviously not like to run into any data license issues (I think saw something similar happened recently with a number of the recent Playground competitions?).\n\nRegarding the Spaceship Titanic it is totally understandable locking the `solution.csv` file. ¿Maybe I could be so bold as to ask Kaggle to perhaps perform the cloning step of the competition for me? The main modification I wanted to make is simply to change the scoring metric from the current classification accuracy to be the [Brier Score Loss](https://www.kaggle.com/code/metric/brier-score-loss) (the `solution.csv` would then have to be binary rather than boolean, whilst keeping the 100% Public split). Obviously I would take care of all of the documentation *etc.* before launching.\n\nThe reason for the new variant of the competition is that I would like to shift the focus towards the competitors creating calibrated classifiers, whilst maintaining transferability of all the domain knowledge regarding Spaceship Titanic that competitors have acquired since its maiden voyage.\n\nI know this is an unusual ask, but I think this variant would be a good learning experience regarding a very important aspect of ML classification.\n\nAll the best,\\\n\ncarl",

You would be required to have some dataset for the competition, it could be a subset or all of what you are using with Orange. That might offer the option to explore methods and models, e.g. from sklearn, in notebooks for those interested.\n\nThere are also cloneable competitions <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?listOption=publiclyCloneable> many from the playground series that might be a reasonable fit for what want to do. It may be possible to clone and then update with your own dataset, have not tried it though. Or perhaps one of those competitions has a dataset that would be what you want to use in Orange.\n\nHave a look at <https://www.kaggle.com/docs/competitions-setup> for all the requirements and steps for setup. You can go through the process and if it is not launched, nothing is visible except for yourself. Good luck!",

(sub-factors: *completeness* and *accessibility*)\n* Reliability: How biased is the data? Biases include: historical, representation, measurement, and aggregation.\n* Sensitivity: How sensitive is the data? Does it contain personal information or data which carries legal, reputational,\\\n\nor political risks?\n* Sufficiency: How much data is enough data?\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F4051350%2Fcda94df7f38c86f209d1d9816e5c5eab%2FDAS.png?generation=1700814796768309&alt=media)\n\nAll in all a very worthwhile read.

However, this time I'm stuck at the step where I need to upload the Solution File. More specifically, I have problems with the Solution Mapping.\n\nI started by uploading my solutions file with the following format:\n\n\n```\nId,Expected,Usage\n0,2200,Public\n1,2400,Private\n2,3150,Private\n3,2100,Public\n4,3400,Public\n…\ncontent\\_copy\n```\nThe upload seems to work (e.g., I can download the file) but I don't get a check mark and it says \"Solution mapping is in progress\" even after more than 30 minutes. The image below shows the info box I see after the upload. The numbers in the Solution Sampling section are correct, but I can't do anything in the Solution Mapping section. It's just a static info box.\n\n![Screenshot of Solution File upload page](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F1135173%2F2e56a0c745946f99745851d986c75346%2Fkaggle-competition-problem.png?generation=1693055083763193&alt=media)\n\nWithout completing this step, I obviously cannot launch the competition.

Such models predict targets not as scalars for given features, but as probability densities, assuming they depend continuously on features. Example: a coin and two dice sets. Coin is flipped, depending on outcome either dice set is selected and rolled, the some of dice roll values is a target, so training records may look like \\\n\n3,5,20\\\n\n8,4,45\\\n\nand so on. The right value is a target, the first two are dice quantities. The goal is to train model in such a way that it predicts probability density for provided features even if they were not part of training set. Also it should be done as black box, assuming no knowledge of underlying physical properties of the system.\\\n\nI made one such model, here is video: \\\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hhJIpzxPR0> \\\n\nI wonder, what are other competitive ways of building such models, besides Bayesian NN and k-NN and are such models in the interest of this site research.",

Is it possible to have Community Competitions that do a re-score on a given date or by maybe by request from the host? \n\nThere may be other forecasting type competitions that could find a scoring date after the submissions deadline useful, not sure if an option like that in host section could be possible? \n\nThanks in advance!",

In this case, I believe that tweets without likes can open up a range of possibilities for model's work.\n\nI am new to the world of dataset creation, but I feel that creating more features and observations will always be a challenge, especially when scraping data.

Are there any specific criteria that make a dataset suitable for a Kaggle competition?\n\nHow do you effectively engage participants and maintain their interest throughout the competition? Are there any strategies or best practices you recommend?\n\nWhat are the common pitfalls or challenges that hosts typically encounter? Are there any lessons learned or tips you can share to ensure a smooth competition experience?\n\nHow should I structure the competition timeline? Are there any recommended durations for each phase (e.g., data exploration, model building, submission)?\n\nAre there any additional resources or tools that you found particularly helpful as a competition host?\n\nAny advice or insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

The problem is the lack of quality data and domain knowledge, as I see it. I would like to bridge that gap, as I come into this with domain knowledge and unique racing data as my forte.. I have long given up making any money on this or becoming the new bill benter, so now I´m all about sharing and caring and having fun. \n\n[I have prepared something here](https://anedvardsen.notion.site/Beating-the-Odds-Kaggle-Challenge-Machine-Learning-for-Horse-Racing-da8f17f00ea94d3998bdf637a5ab158d), including datasets, data descriptions, an intro, some inspiration from previous best efforts I've come across, and also a Q&A-session for asking me about anything related to the domain (horse racing and betting). \n\nI had planned to host a competition, but I realize that even that is a bit beyond my capabilities. Especially with the scoring part which I had forgot was an obvious demand.. Is it a foolish idea for a competition anyway, or should I try to find a way? ",

        "content": "## Hi Kagglers!\n\nWe’re happy to announce a number of updates for competition hosts. These include UI updates to the **Overview Tab** and **Host Settings**, as well as a new feature we’ve been calling **Private Competitions**. \n\n**These changes are rolling out gradually, so if you don’t see them now, you can expect to see them soon!**\n\n\n\n---\n\n## UI Updates\n\nWe’ve updated the Overview tab ui to align with the larger design system we’re rolling out across Kaggle. The design should be familiar if you’ve used a dataset, notebook or model on Kaggle.\n\nThe two-column design shows competition details in a main column, and meta-data on the right hand side. In the main column, a new overview section allows hosts to succinctly explain the details for a competition.\n\n![Image of an editable competition](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2Ffae02a83b77e60c81f42811ef1336c84%2FHost%20-%20Editing%20Exposed.png?generation=1692819656602865&alt=media)\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Inline editing\n\nCompetition hosts will now be able to edit competition contents and tags inline. Anywhere you see the Pencil icon is a place you can edit. Editing any of the sections opens up a markdown editor where you can edit and format content inline.\n\n![Image of editing form](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2Fe77bd7c2e63a8e2bbe3a2f31c6cc090a%2Fediting.75.png?generation=1692832498989097&alt=media)\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Host tab\n\nThe Host tab has also been updated to align with the Kaggle design system. \n\nThis tab is where you’ll do the work to set up your competition - entering **Basic Details**, adding **Images**, adding **Hosts**, setting your **Evaluation Metric**, viewing **Teams & Submissions**, and reviewing the **Launch Checklist**.\n\n![Image of Host Tab](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2Fc948c2119689472c31a46b320e591451%2FHost%20Controls%20-%20Refactor%20Community%20Host.png?generation=1692819855149257&alt=media)\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Time-zone Support\n\n![Image of deadline settings](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2Fa4bc92e1df7325618d54d0c05d11236a%2Ftimezone.75.png?generation=1692832559736564&alt=media)\n\nIf you’ve hosted a competition, you’ve probably done the mental math to convert UTC to your local timezone when setting the deadline. With today’s updates, the timezone defaults to your local time automatically. You can change this if you wish to.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Teams & Submissions\n\n![Image of Teams & Submissions](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2Fe56e8054031774ef338c2a478035c2dc%2FHost%20Controls%20-%20All%20Submissions%20Expandable%20Panel.png?generation=1692819970091229&alt=media)\n\nWe’ve also improved the way that Teams & Submissions are displayed. You should notice a faster load time for viewing teams, and an easier way to navigate their submissions.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Launch Checklist\n\nThe Launch Checklist provides a workflow to your competition setup. It’s now organized by the work that you do when hosting a competition: Content & Setup, Data, Evaluation & Testing, and Launch & Sharing.\n\n![Image of Launch Checklist](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F5425251%2Fbd2f0385aa8191beba3fc2def2b1d0c3%2Fchecklist.75.png?generation=1692832588939297&alt=media)\n\nEach section has the tasks laid out. A green checkmark tells you when you’ve completed a section. When you’re ready to launch, the bottom section will provide you a way to launch or schedule launch.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Private Competitions\n\nWe've also worked one of the top requested features from Community Competition hosts: private competitions. Read more about private competitions in [this forum post](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/competition-hosting/436050).\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Feedback or Suggestions?\n\nWe’re interested to hear about your experience with this change. If you notice any issues or have feedback, please reply to this post.\n\nThanks to the hard work of [@bovard](https://www.kaggle.com/bovard) [@develra](https://www.kaggle.com/develra) [@dominoweir](https://www.kaggle.com/dominoweir) [@dster](https://www.kaggle.com/dster) [@jonlipovetz](https://www.kaggle.com/jonlipovetz) on this!\n\nHappy Kaggling!",

In my competition I made the usual assumption that the `user_id` column is not a feature, and from the very start in the sample notebook I provide I directly specify said column as the index column. Well today one of my students has discovered a **huge** data leak when actually using the aforementioned column as a feature (needless to say I was unaware of this leak beforehand).\n\nIn kaggle competitions it has long been a bit of a sport to find the *magic* that directly results in a fantastic LB score. Well now I have a small dose of the feeling that the kaggle team must have when users actually *do* find the magic; the weird sinking feeling of the competition is broken, and nobody will now bother to try to solve it in the way intended, and the strong urge to nullify and restart the competition with the leak patched…\n\nTL;DR: I would just like to say a huge thanks to [@inversion](https://www.kaggle.com/inversion), [@wcukierski](https://www.kaggle.com/wcukierski) and all the others on the competitions side for all the hard work over the years to create great competitions; competing in a competition is very hard, but creating a good robust competition is just as hard too.\n\nAll the best,\\\n\ncarl",

It provides a fun and engaging way to test our knowledge and compete with our peers. I also like that we are provided with training material beforehand to prepare for the test.\n\nHowever, I do have a concern about the potential for cheating. Since the test can be taken online and the answers are automatically checked, there may be a risk of students sharing answers or looking up the answers online. It would be great if there could be measures put in place to prevent cheating, such as timed tests or randomization of questions and answer choices.\n\nRegarding the suggestion for Kaggle to provide templates for MCQ tests, I think that would be really helpful for both educators and students. It would make it easier for educators to create and administer tests, and for students to understand the format and requirements of the test.",

I wanted to take a moment to talk about the importance of weekly competitions on Kaggle's Playground.\n\nAs you know, Kaggle provides a platform for learners and professionals alike to work on real-world problems and showcase their skills in data science and machine learning. One of the best ways to improve our skills and learn from others is through competitions.\n\nRecently, I have noticed that the Playground competitions on Kaggle have become a fortnightly event, which is less frequent than before. While I understand the need for change and optimization, I strongly believe that having weekly competitions is more beneficial for learners.\n\nWeekly competitions provide us with a consistent opportunity to practice our skills, learn new techniques, and get feedback from our peers. They also help us stay engaged with the Kaggle community and foster a sense of healthy competition.\n\nTherefore, I would like to request Kaggle to restore the weekly Playground competitions so that we can continue to learn and grow as data scientists. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and support for this cause.\n\nThank you for your time and happy learning!",

                "content": "Hello [@gauravduttakiit](https://www.kaggle.com/gauravduttakiit), we have a deluge of competitions ongoing with more than 10 featured assignments spanning from tabular challenges to image and NLP assignments. They all offer a great learning experience and an opportunity to earn medals too. I think these, in addition to a fortnightly playground series tabular challenge are more than sufficient to provide an enthusiast with a rounded experience in this regard. \n\nIn my opinion, a weekly challenge is quite tedious with virtually no time to look into the data and perform data engineering, the most important part of any ML assignment. In such situations, many of us merely resort to concocting public notebook features into a GBM and make submissions, a sub-optimal approach in my opinion. Many of us are also involved in studies, work and other commitments and this weekly routine becomes an issue to balance Kaggle with other walks of life too, an added disadvantage. \n\nA fortnightly cadence allows us to look into the data in detail and perhaps perform our own data engineering prior to developing models on our own. It also allows us to balance time between Kaggle and work/ school/ college too, an added advantage. All in all, a 15-day cycle seems to be an apt timeline for these challenges, rendering a better learning opportunity overall, along with some space for other facets too. ",

I think competitions should be arranged in such a way that this transition from Playground series to Paid competitions should go smoothly(at least to some extent).",

                        "content": "Hi Kapadnis,\n\nMy tips for students and beginners, simply Join a competition, try to run some script (at the level you're prepared) and learn how difficult is to deal with any data, sometimes even to open some files, mostly the huge ones when our poor memory will stop you right at the beginning of your code.\n\nIf you copy Anyone, always provide their credits. Mention: \"thanks to …. I was able to open/plot that step.\"\n\nIn case, you couldn't make a decent submission. Join the competition and try what you can. No one is obliged to make submissions. That's Kaggle Freedom, nothing is compulsory.\n\nDon't feel shy to make things that seem stupid and got program errors. Maybe some generous Kaggler could give you a tip if you write: \" I got that error and didn't find answers to fix it on my searchs\" \n\nNot trying anything and expecting to learn just by reading, isn't the same. Only when we run snippet by snippet we find out our weaknesses.\n\nDon't wait for that transition (from Playground series to Paid competitions). Besides, we have Research (e.g. FathomNet 2023 only knowledge, I suffered there just to load some images with Json files) and community competitions (e.g. Predict My Sleep Patterns, prize GPU). In sum, we have plenty of competitions to optimize your skills.\n\nBy the way, DON'T BOTHER about MEDALS. We're here to learn, not to collect medals. Except, those that are going to win the competition.\n\nAdditionally, Notebooks could Not be downvoted. If someone don't like it, make a comment (at least that isn't anonymized). Except when the Notebook's author made a misconduct. There we communicate to Kaggle Compliance.\n\nAs I mentioned above, don't be shy to make your work public. And don't lose opportunities to learn.\n\nSince I'm not a professional (and don't intend to be) I don't have reputations to lose trying to publish things that I've never seen/heard before. \n\nAt the end , I always learn something New. That's what really matters (for me).\n\nKind regards,\\\n\nMarília.",

How to solve this? \n\nBelow is the picture. \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F759131%2Fa4ada331d73fe6752e58855ae057cae2%2FBez%20naslova.jpg?generation=1676365645691468&alt=media) \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F759131%2Fdde1eb4c3da4e295cf1871031eb37761%2FScreenshot_7.png?generation=1676369895458529&alt=media)",

For context, offering prizes in Community Competitions is currently against our terms (when creating a competition, one must check a box that says `I confirm that this competition agrees with Kaggle’s site terms and will not offer cash prizes without prior approval by the Kaggle Team.`) This policy was in place to prevent exactly this scenario, where someone unaffiliated with Kaggle fails to deliver on promised prizes. In competitions run by Kaggle on our main page, we handle prize payment to ensure what is promised is delivered. We are currently working on approvals and updates that may allow community hosts to award prizes, however, those changes are not yet live.\n\nI will reach out to the host of this competition about this issue, however, noting their profile says \"last seen 3 months ago\", I can't say I'm confident in a response.",

Also, the header image never occupies the full width of a standard monitor (the image seems to use only around 60% of the full width) so I think this requirement could perhaps be relaxed a little, to maybe even 1200 x 250?\n\nAll the best,\\\n\ncarl",

Awhile back there was a promotion when these became available for anyone to host, from memory there were some awards for the best in each month and possibility to then be a featured competition. So maybe a similar idea that could be adapted to a playground series? ",

However, I can only see that it meets the requirement for participants to submit their models in a specific format, but I am not clear on how to evaluate the submissions using custom scripts. Additionally, another staff member from the forum answered a similar question two days ago and stated that: (<https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/competition-hosting/393000)：>\\\n\n“Also, we are going to shortly (within months) be launching custom python metrics, where you'll be able to write any arbitrary evaluation function” and “The current evaluation pipeline is written in C# and not public, so it's unfortunately not currently possible to write your own, hence why we are building a DIY python metrics substitute”\\\n\nCould you please explain this? I am confused.\\\n\nIn addition, I want to confirm that ordinary community competitions cannot support my two requirements, correct?",

This year, as part of my community contribution, I organized a Kaggle competition with the support of CORD.ai for NLP enthusiasts. So here it is. We have quite a few competitors already at work on the leaderboard. If you are interested in the competition, arxiv paper classification, multi label classification please consider joining.\n\n### Link: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cordai-arxiv-paper-classification/overview>\n\n### Problem Statement:\n\nThe goal of this competition is to identify the categories associated to an research paper hosted on ArXiv. Originally a research paper can have one or more categories associated to it, if so then you need to predict the list of categories that belongs to that paper. Hence the problem statement is a multi-label classification problem.\n\n### Timeline\n\nJanuary 27, 2023 [10:30 PM IST] - Start Date.\\\n\nFebruary 13, 2023 [12 AM IST] - Final Submission Deadline.\n\nThe competition organizers reserve the right to update the contest timeline if they deem it necessary.\n\n### Competition Host:\n\nThis Competition is only possible because of the CORD.ai community and its great members encouraging democratisation of AI research by means of collaboration. The competition is a part of the 1st edition of the Deep Learning Symposium organised by CORD, and we hope we will organise more great sessions and events like this in near future. If you resonate with the objective of CORD and want to be a part of this amazing community please fill up this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScm1WHIbK6LIsYBuGkBklXlINAFWURoKBXYsLqVDHv9O4JA3w/viewform) and follow our socials,\n\n* [Website](https://cordai.org/)\n* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CRforAi)\n* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/company/cord-ai1/mycompany/",

We hope that Simulation Competitions will provide the opportunity for Kagglers to practice and hone this burgeoning skill”. I fully agree with this statement.\\\n\nThe code competition consists of the development of an RL model which mimics the process of solving a Sudoku puzzle on paper by a human player.\\\n\nIn short, does this competition has its place on the Kaggle platform? If not, can you let me know about a scientific community that would be interested in the project?\\\n\nAttached you will find a description of the competition.\\\n\nI also created a demo notebook which explains the contents of the training dataset : [https://www.kaggle.com/code/sudokoach/artificial-sudoku-player.](url)\n\n[Artificial Sudoku Player.pdf](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/2568588/20096/Artificial Sudoku Player.pd",

        "content": "Welcome back for another installment of 🤓Cloneable Competitions for the Classroom🤓 where we show you step-by-step how to copy and launch one of our [cloneable competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions?listOption=publiclyCloneable) in less than 15 minutes!\n\nThis time we are featuring an [Audio Binary Classification Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dont-call-me-turkey/overview)!\n\n### Quick look\n\n* *Name*: [Don’t call me turkey!](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dont-call-me-turkey/overview)\n* *Skills*: Audio binary classification\n* *Summary*: Build a model on a series of audio files to determine if they are made by a turkey or not.\n\n\n> \n> In this competition you are tasked with finding the turkey sound signature from pre-extracted audio features. A simple binary problem, or is it? What does a turkey really sound like? How many sounds are similar? Will you be able to find the turkey or will you go a-fowl?\n> \n> \n> \n\n### The Data\n\nCheck out the EDA section of [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/frtgnn/yam-potatoes-thanksgiving-2018) from [@frtgnn](https://www.kaggle.com/frtgnn) for a good exploratory data analysis. \n\n![graph showing target label counts](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F50767%2F77b98cced7e68d7a9a5759928514e143%2Fturkeygraph.png?generation=1667940588642610&alt=media)\n\n## Creation\n\n##### Creation Steps\n\n1. Copy the competition\n2. Make edits and launch\n\n### Step 1: Copy the competition\n\n![gif showing steps to clone the competition](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F50767%2F55753a5c322f955a65f90db62313c19a%2Fturkey2.gif?generation=1667946201531641&alt=media)\n\n1. Go to the [competition overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dont-call-me-turkey/overview)\n2. Click the three dots in the upper right\n3. Click “Make a Copy”\n4. Chose a name\n\t1. Suggested: Audio Classification Competition - your class/group/event\n5. Chose a url\n\t1. Suggested: audio-classification-competition-your-class-group-event\n6. Select Limited\n7. Click “Continue”\n\nAt this point you should have your own copy of the competition! Before you launch, however, you should make some edits.\n\n### Step 2: Recommended Edits\n\n* Overview Tab\n\t+ Timeline:\n\t\t- Update to your timeline\n\t+ Prizes:\n\t\t- Remove this page or update with class rules\n* Host Tab\n\t+ Settings\n\t\t- Update the Brief Description\n\t\t\t* Mention your class/event\n\t\t- Update the Deadline\n* Rules Tab\n\t+ Replace with the rules for your event\n\t+ Include things like rules on sharing and team mergers\n\nAt this point, heading over the Host tab, the “Launch Checklist” should say you are ready for launch! You can either schedule the launch for a specific time or launch right away. Participants will not be able to see or join the competition until it has launched.\n\n### Helpful tips\n\n1. This competition is “on your honor” not to include the test data in your training. This would not be suitable for competitions where you need this information to be hidden.\n2. Encourage participants to create and share their notebooks!\n3. There are a ton of high quality notebooks on the [original competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dont-call-me-turkey/code?competitionId=11880&sortBy=voteCount) you can quickly pull interesting models and create lessons around.\n4. Encourage participants to help each other on the discussions forum!\n5. There is a limited number of submissions per day, if you want to run a hackathon or event consider increasing it. This can be edited in the host -> settings tab.\n\nIf you get stuck please comment below - I’m sure I’ve left out a step somewhere and your questions will help others. Happy Hosting!",

That way the business would know that their model may not be too bad even if its not yielding their expected results.",

It measures the ability of the model to avoid false positives.\\\n\n3.Recall (Sensitivity): The number of true positive predictions divided by the sum of true positive and false negative predictions. It measures the ability of the model to identify positive instances.\\\n\n4.F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a single metric that balances precision and recall.\\\n\n5.Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC): It measures the ability of a binary classification model to discriminate between positive and negative instances across different probability thresholds. A higher AUC-ROC indicates better model performance.\\\n\n6.Mean Squared Error (MSE): A commonly used metric for regression problems. It calculates the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. Smaller MSE values indicate better performance.",

        "content": "Welcome to the first installment of 🤓Cloneable Competitions for the Classroom🤓 where we feature one of our cloneable competitions. Even if you know nothing about Kaggle, using these simple steps you can get the competition up and running in 15 minutes. If you get stuck please comment below - I’m sure I’ve left out a step somewhere and your questions will help others!\n\nThis time we are featuring a [Sales Forecasting Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jan-2022) from our tabular playground series.\n\n#### Quick look\n\n* *Name*: [Tabular Playground Series - Jan 2022](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jan-2022)\n* *Skills*: Intermediate Time Series / Forecasting on a Tabular Dataset\n* *Summary*: Build sales forecasts to help the Kaggle team figure out whether KaggleMart or KaggleRama should become the official Kaggle merchandise store.\n\n\n> \n> There are two (fictitious) independent store chains selling Kaggle merchandise that want to become the official outlet for all things Kaggle. We've decided to see if the Kaggle community could help us figure out which of the store chains would have the best sales going forward. So, we've collected some data and are asking you to build forecasting models to help us decide.\n> \n> \n> Help us figure out whether KaggleMart or KaggleRama should become the official Kaggle outlet!\n> \n> \n> \n\n#### The Data\n\nGet a very good basic understanding of the data from this competition by reading through [@ambrosm](https://www.kaggle.com/ambrosm)’s exploratory data analysis notebook: [TPSJAN22-01 EDA which makes sense](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambrosm/tpsjan22-01-eda-which-makes-sense)\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F50767%2F82c992a9ce3a50264209613f1ed49778%2Fhistogram.png?generation=1667429989934314&alt=media)\n\n## Creation\n\nCreation Steps\n\n1. Copy the competition\n2. Make edits and launch\n3. Add helpful notebooks (optional)\n\n#### Step 1: Copy the competition\n\n1. Go to the [competition overview](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jan-2022)\n2. Click the three dots in the upper right\n3. Click “Make a Copy”\n4. Chose a name\n\t1. Suggested: Sales Forecasting Competition - your class/group/event\n5. Chose a url\n\t1. Suggested: Sales-forecasting-competition-your-class-group-event\n6. Click “Continue”\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F50767%2Fc9749ab7598c98063bbbc71bd4e77b95%2Fcreatgif.gif?generation=1667429878211612&alt=media)\n\nAt this point you should have a new competition. Before you launch, however, you should make some edits.\n\n#### Step 2: Recommended Edits\n\n* Overview Tab\n\t+ Description:\n\t\t- Remove “About Tabular Playground Series”\n\t+ Timeline:\n\t\t- Update to your timeline\n\t+ Prizes:\n\t\t- Remove this page or update with class rules\n* Host Tab\n\t+ Settings\n\t\t- Update the Brief Description\n\t\t\t* Mention your class/event\n\t\t- Update the Deadline\n\t\t- Update access to “Invitation Only” (unless running a public event)\n\t+ Images\n\t\t- Grab a nice image you have a license for, or use an image associated with your school or organization\n* Rules Tab\n\t+ Replace with the rules for your event\n\t+ Include things like rules on sharing and team mergers\n\nAt this point, heading over the Host tab, the “Launch Checklist” should say you are ready for launch! You can either schedule the launch for a specific time or launch right away. Participants will not be able to see or join the competition until it has launched.\n\n#### Step 3: Add helpful notebooks (optional)\n\nRun this step AFTER launching your competition.\n\nLooking at the original competition [Code tab sorting by most votes](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-jan-2022/code?competitionId=33101&sortBy=voteCount) there are a couple really high quality notebooks you might want to consider adding to your competition. \n\nI would recommend “[TPSJAN22-01 EDA which makes sense](https://www.kaggle.com/code/ambrosm/tpsjan22-01-eda-which-makes-sense)” by [@ambrosm](https://www.kaggle.com/ambrosm) as a great exploratory data analysis notebook to get your participants acquainted with the dataset. All public notebooks are released under the Apache 2.0 license so perfect to use in your class!\n\nIf you want any of these to show up:\n\n1. click the “…” -> Copy and Edit\n2. On the right hand side open the menu with the >| icon\n3. Click Data -> “+ Add Data”\n4. Click “Competition Datasets” and search for your competition by name\n5. Click the + button to add.\n6. Navigate to your Code tab the notebook should be there!\n\n### Helpful tips\n\n1. If you don’t want people outside your group to join the competition, make it “Invite only” (see Host -> Settings)\n2. Have students create and share their own notebooks!\n\t1. You might start off with an EDA (exploratory data analysis) notebook\n\t2. Assign different teams to attempt different model types and share the results in a notebook\n3. Encourage engagement with the discussions tab\n\t1. Our kaggle competitions have a thriving community here and yours can too!\n4. Encourage more frequent submissions rather than saving it all till the night before. There is a per day limit on submissions!\n\t1. This setting can be tweaked in the Host tab -> Settings pag",

However, if I were to choose a metric like AUC (which was the initial plan) where it matters how it is configured for multi-class evaluation, e.g., averaging class performance and one-vs-one/one-vs-rest, I need to know exactly how it is configured. I should at least be able to see the underlying code for every metric, in case hosts should only be able to pick metrics from a pre-defined list.",
