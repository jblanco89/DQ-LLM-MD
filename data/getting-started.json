        "content": "This is from *Intro to Programming course part 5, question 5*\n\nQuestion :\n\nSay you're doing analytics for a website. You need to write a function that returns the percentage growth in the total number of users relative to a specified number of years ago.\n\nYour function percentage\\_growth() should take two arguments as input:\n\nnum\\_users = Python list with the total number of users each year. So num\\_users[0] is the total number of users in the first year, num\\_users[1] is the total number of users in the second year, and so on. The final entry in the list gives the total number of users in the most recently completed year.\\\n\nyrs\\_ago = number of years to go back in time when calculating the growth percentage\\\n\nFor instance, say \\\n\nnum\\_users = [920344, 1043553, 1204334, 1458996, 1503323, 1593432, 1623463, 1843064, 1930992, 2001078].\n\nif yrs\\_ago = 1, we want the function to return a value of about 0.036. This corresponds to a percentage growth of approximately 3.6%, calculated as (2001078 - 1930992)/1930992.\n\nif years\\_ago = 7, we would want to return approximately 0.66. This corresponds to a percentage growth of approximately 66%, calculated as (2001078 - 1204334)/1204334.\n\nYour coworker sent you a draft of a function, but it doesn't seem to be doing the correct calculation. Can you figure out what has gone wrong and make the needed changes?\n\n\n```\n# TODO: Edit the function\ndef percentage\\_growth(num\\_users, yrs\\_ago):\n    growth = (num_users[len(num_users)-1] - num_users[len(num_users)-yrs_ago])/num_users[len(num_users)-2]\n    return growth\n\n#Do not change: Variable for calculating some test examples\nnum_users_test = [920344, 1043553, 1204334, 1458996, 1503323, 1593432, 1623463, 1843064, 1930992, 2001078]\n\n#Do not change: Should return .036\nprint(percentage_growth(num_users_test, 1))\n\n#Do not change: Should return 0.66\nprint(percentage_growth(num_users_test, 7))\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n1. So to calculate, you need to subtract the current user from the user from particular number of years ago right ?\\\n\ncan't we just do it by (user from years ago - current user / user from years ago)\\*100 ?\n2. What does the len() contribute here ? Why do we need it since we already have the number directly and we are not counting the length of something, right ?\n\nI am pretty new to this, so please correct me if I am wrong\n\nThank you so much for the guidance",

You could also use BatchNormalization Layers In the beginning and between Dense layers to make sure the weights are normalized after each layer. Try both to see if that helps! \\\n\nAnother things to consider is that you could reduce the number of nodes in each layer or reduce the total layers. Good luck! ",

I am learning python basics in YouTube right now and came across this community. \n\nI tried to do the courses in the learn section, but it seemed little difficult for me to understand - I just skimmed through the *Into to programming* course's first section and was able to answer the questions with no difficulty, but going further, I guess I get stuck mainly in actually understanding the question.\n\nDo you think I should build a foundation in my python skills before I do the courses or is it just about getting used to Kaggle's (/ Professional world's) style of wording ?\n\nThank you ",

        "content": "## **Introduction**\n\nThe documentation of a project, process, user guide, or package is one way to ensure that everything that was planned has been implemented and is in place. A detailed document is not only essential for the end user but also for technical teams which need to refer to the document quite often. It is also one of the most boring, time-consuming activities but also the most important aspect of the project and a good investment for the future. A standard approach with the right kind of tools would go a long way in generating documents that are easy to use, search, navigate, and reuse. Python libraries like Sphinx and Mkdocs will let us generate these documents automatically from the code with no additional effort on documentation. \n\n## **Overview of Sphinx**\n\nSphinx is open source, written in Python, and was primarily built for Python documentation but it also supports a wide range of languages. Sphinx uses reStructuredText markup language by default which is specially designed for technical documentation. The easy-to-configure themes and extensions make it the most popular documentation library.\n\nHere is the snapshot of the document generated - [GitHub](https://github.com/amitvkulkarni/Blogs/tree/main/Sphinx%20Vs%20MkDocs%20%7C%20Powerful%20Documentation%20Using%20Python)\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F4876670%2Fea3872cfcb9e52886c746ffbc72a41d5%2Fsphinx-home-2.png?generation=1711175697375120&alt=media)\n\n## **Overview of MkDocs**\n\nMkDocs is a simple-to-use static site generator based on markdown. It is written in Python but is language-agnostic and a good choice of technical documentation where speed and simplicity are important. As it is a markdown, one can preview the content on the go. A good collection of themes and its easy customization make it a more attractive option for writing and building documentation. When coupled with mkdocstrings, it is a powerful tool for document generation from sources.\n\nHere is the snapshot of the document generated - [GitHub](https://github.com/amitvkulkarni/Blogs/tree/main/Sphinx%20Vs%20MkDocs%20%7C%20Powerful%20Documentation%20Using%20Python)\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F4876670%2Fc69df01eea6f900ca464a706df3fe643%2Fmkdocs-home.png?generation=1711175738447160&alt=media)\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nThere are various ways to document a project or package and everyone has their preference depending on the nature of the project and its complexity. We have explored and learned two most popular libraries in Python for auto-generated documents. Sphinx is the most popular and is widely used, most of the Python package documentation is built from Sphinx. The mkdocs, on the other hand, uses markdown, and I find it easier to configure and use. The combination of mkdocs and mkdocstrings would generate the same result as that of the sphinx. I highly recommend exploring and leveraging the power of both frameworks.\n\n## **Official documentation for reference**\n\n<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html>\\\n\n<https://www.mkdocs.org/>\n\n## **Quick start code on [GitHub](https://github.com/amitvkulkarni/Blogs/tree/main/Sphinx%20Vs%20MkDocs%20%7C%20Powerful%20Documentation%20Using%20Python)**",

These are a lot of platform to findout the right dataset for your project.\\\n\n1.)Kaggle 2.) UCI Machine Learning 3.) build your own custom data set 4.) Asking Perplexity AI a platform similar to chatgpt but more advance one. it will give you Kaggle link, Github link to your desire dataset.\n\n# Perform Data Analytics\n\nAfter finding your desire dataset you can perform Data Analytics, for performing Data Analytics you can prepare 10 critical question that hit your mind while seeing dataset . For example : which is the highest price smartphone , which company have the lowest price range. like this you can think about it.\n\n# Create a blog on your Data Analytics Insights\n\nYou can write a blog in the form of story telling about your Insights . A lot of you may be asked me that why I have to do this , so let me discuss some advantages for this.\\\n\n1.) It increase your story telling ability as a lot of data role needs good story telling to their stack holders .\\\n\n2.) You have lot of things to talk about in your interview , as a lot of you don't have a lot of things to discuss when it comes to interview.\\\n\n3.) It increase your online presence.\n\n# Preparing A ML Model\n\nafter the data analytics is done now it time to create a ML model from our dataset a lot of step involve in this like \\\n\n1.) finding NULL values \\\n\n2.) Handling Outliers\\\n\n3.) Data Preprocessing\\\n\n4.) Model Building\\\n\n5.) Model Evaluation\\\n\n6.) Fine Tuning of your Model \n\n# Deployment\n\nDeployment is an optional part of your project either you can use kaggle notebook link or you can build an GUI for your project using Tkinter or some other tools to deploy your model.\n\n# Bonus : Project Ideas you can work on it\n\n1. Laptop Price prediction\n2. Laptop recommendation system\n3. Smartphone Price prediction\n4. Smartphone recommendation system\n5. Smart watch price prediction\n6. Smart watch recommendation System\n7. Manga Recommendation System\n8. Anime Recommendation Syste",

If your YOLO model is hogging GPU memory and you wanna switch to TPU on Kaggle, it's pretty straightforward. Just go to the \"Accelerator\" settings, pick TPU, and install the TPU libraries with a simple command. Then, tweak your code to use PyTorch XLA for TPU, adjust your data loading and training loops, and you're good to go! It's all about making sure your model plays nice with TPU's parallel power. Give it a shot and see how it goes!",

These are free of charge and cover a variety of areas from beginner to advanced level. The courses also introduce you to Kaggle competitions which you can later use to improve your site ranking.\n\nBest wishes,\n\nPhil",

Can anyone suggest me a **go-to place** where I can refer to **beginner level notebooks** to train simple LLMs on simple tasks, before trying out on complex tasks. Considering I am not from a technical background, and so looking for resources that are technical friendly as well, but it's not a must as I have my friend ChatGPT :).\n\nIt will also be helpful if people could share **entry level competitions** on Kaggle, to rapidly grow knowledge in the field and participate in active discussions.\n\nI am sure many of us would have been lost in their initial phase, and would have found their way out of the fog, so requesting such person to share their experience and learning resources for the same.\n\nI am sure this post will benefit the community.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n[NLP](/discussions?tags=13204-NLP)[GPT2](/discussions?tags=17154-GPT2)[Beginner](/discussions?tags=13102-Beginner)[Education](/discussions?tags=11105-Educatio",

We’ve tried collecting data from various sources, but it has been quite exhausting.\n\nHonestly, I’m not sure if we’re too young for this, but a professor mentioned Kaggle to me. So, I’m reaching out here as our last hope. Does anyone know of any biased datasets that we can use for Fair-SMOTE and gather experimental results? Thank you in advance! ❤️\"",

        "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nWe are sharing a series of notebooks to help Kagglers to get started with the machine learning frameworks JAX and FLAX.\n\n**Intro to JAX**\n\n[JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) is a framework which is used for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research developed by [Google Research](https://research.google/). It allows you to build Python applications with a NumPy-consistent API that specializes in differentiating, vectorizing, parallelizing, and compiling to GPU/TPU Just-In-Time. JAX was designed with performance and speed as a first priority, and is natively compatible with common machine learning accelerators such as [GPUs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/efficient-gpu-usage) and [TPUs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu). Large ML models can take ages to train -- you might be interested in using JAX for applications where speed and performance are particularly important!\n\n**When to use JAX vs TensorFlow?**\n\n[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide) is a mature product, with a rich and fully-featured ecosystem, capable of supporting most every use case a machine learning practitioner might have (e.g. [TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) for on-device inference computing, [TFHub](https://tfhub.dev/) for sharing pre-trained models, and many additional specialized applications as well). This type of broad mandate both contrasts and compliments JAX's philosophy, which is more narrowly focused on speed and performance. We recommend using JAX in situations where you do want to maximize speed and performance but you do not require any of the long tail of features and additional functionalities that only the [TensorFlow ecosystem](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn) can provide. \n\n**Intro to FLAX**\n\nJust like [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html) focuses on speed, other members of the JAX ecosystem are encouraged to specialize as well. For example, [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) focuses on neural networks and [jgraph](https://github.com/deepmind/jraph) focuses on graph networks. \n\n[Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a JAX-based neural network library that was initially developed by Google Research's Brain Team (in close collaboration with the JAX team) but is now open source. If you want to train machine learning models on GPUs and TPUs at an accelerated speed, or if you have an ML project that might benefit from bringing together both [Autograd](https://github.com/hips/autograd) and [XLA](https://www.tensorflow.org/xla), consider using [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for your next project! [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is especially well-suited for projects that use large language models, and is a popular choice for cutting-edge [machine learning research](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=JAX&searchtype=all&abstracts=show&order=-announced_date_first&size=50).\n\n**You can also use the JAX/FLAX framework in your notebooks to make submissions for the [Google OSS Expert prize](https://www.kaggle.com/google-oss-expert-prize) program.**\n\n**How can I get started with JAX/FLAX?**\n\nHere are some getting started notebooks on how to use JAX/FLAX with different dataset formats for training machine learning models. \n\n* [Digit Recognizer using JAX/FLAX (Toy image dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/nilaychauhan/digit-recognizer-using-jax-flax)\n* [Dog Breed Classification using JAX/FLAX (Image Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/nilaychauhan/dog-breed-classification-using-jax-and-flax)\n* [Jigsaw toxic comment classification using JAX/FLAX (Text Dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/nilaychauhan/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-using-jax-flax)\n* [Cornell BirdCall classification using JAX/FLAX (Audio dataset)](https://www.kaggle.com/nilaychauhan/cornell-birdcall-audio-recognition-using-jax-flax)\n\nLikewise, this recently launched [community competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/goodreads-books-reviews-290312/overview) has both a large training dataset and a problem statement that benefits from fine-tuning a large language model -- it might be a great place to try out JAX as well!\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\n**We recommend using [GPUs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/efficient-gpu-usage) when working with JAX on Kaggle.** These notebooks are compatible with the v3-8 [TPUs](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/tpu) that are provided for free in [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code/new), but JAX was optimized for the newly updated [TPU VM](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/introducing-cloud-tpu-vms) architecture which is not yet available on Kaggle.",

                "content": "That's great to hear that you're sharing notebooks to help others get started with JAX and FLAX! These frameworks offer powerful capabilities for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research. JAX provides a NumPy-consistent API with a focus on speed, performance, and compatibility with GPUs and TPUs. It's a great choice when you prioritize efficiency and don't require the full range of features offered by TensorFlow. FLAX, on the other hand, is a JAX-based neural network library developed by Google Research's Brain Team. It specializes in neural networks and is particularly well-suited for projects involving large language models. It integrates both Autograd and XLA to enable accelerated training on GPUs and TPUs. To get started with JAX and FLAX, you can explore the provided notebooks that cover various dataset formats and machine learning tasks such as digit recognition, dog breed classification, toxic comment classification, and Cornell BirdCall classification. These notebooks will guide you through using JAX and FLAX in different scenarios, allowing you to gain hands-on experience. Additionally, there is a community competition that focuses on fine-tuning a large language model. It could be an excellent opportunity to apply JAX and FLAX in a practical problem-solving context. Please note that while JAX notebooks are compatible with v3-8 TPUs available on Kaggle for free, it's recommended to use GPUs for optimal performance. The JAX framework was optimized for the newly updated TPU VM architecture, which is not yet available on Kaggle. Best of luck with your JAX and FLAX exploration, and I hope your notebooks and contributions will help others in the Kaggle community!",

Definitely, it will attract more kagglers.\n\nOn courses, it' s easier to adhere to new libraries, tools whatever new is coming.\n\nThink about that kaggle team. Nilay join Alexis (head of courses) and build a Jumpin' (Rocking) Jax/ Flax micro course :)",

        "content": "**Hey, fellow Kagglers!** 🙋‍♀️ \n\nA few days back, I stumbled upon a thought-provoking discussion here about the interpretability of deep learning models, often referred to as \"black boxes.\" In current times, deep learning is being increasingly used across various sectors, and understanding the workings of these models is becoming more and more crucial.\n\n## Deep Learning via Explainable AI (XAI) 🔮\n\nDeep learning models can seem mysterious with their intricate layers and complex structures. Explainable AI (XAI) offers several approaches to shed light on their decision making processes.\n\n* **LIME and SHAP:** are tools that explain individual predictions by attributing the prediction decision to each feature's contribution.\\\n\n**Lime Example**\n\n\n```\nimport lime\nfrom lime import lime_tabular\n# For a model trained on X\\_train\nexplainer = lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(\n    training_data=np.array(X_train),\n    feature_names=X_train.columns,\n    class_names=['Negative', 'Positive'],\n    mode='classification')\nexp = explainer.explain_instance(data_row=X_train.iloc[1], predict_fn=model.predict_proba)\nexp.show_in_notebook(show_table=True)\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n**Sharp Example**\n\n\n```\nimport shap\nshap.initjs()\nexplainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)\nshap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_train)\nshap.force_plot(explainer.expected_value[1], shap_values[1][0], X_train.iloc[0])\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n* **Feature Visualization:** This technique reveals which features are prioritized by the model, aiding in deciphering its focus.\n* **Attention Mechanisms:** Originally from the NLP world, show what parts of the input data are most influential in the model's decisions.\n* **Model Simplification:** Striving for simplicity, this approach attempts to make complex models more interpretable without significantly impacting their accuracy.\n* **Interactive Visualization Tools:** By enabling the dynamic exploration of how input modifications alter outputs, these tools offer hands-on insights into model behavior.\n\n## Trade-offs in Deep Learning Explainability ⚖\n\nWhile seeking interpretability in deep learning, we encounter some trade-offs mentioned below:\n\n* **Accuracy vs. Explainability:** Increasing a model's explainability can sometimes compromise its accuracy, a careful balance to maintain performance is essential.\n* **Complexity of Interpretation Methods:** Some interpretability techniques can be intricate, challenging their practical application.\n* **Contextual Relevance:** Explanations must resonate with domain-specific insights to be actionable and meaningful.\n\n## Resources for Further Learning 📚\n\nTo delve deeper into the world of Explainable AI and interpretability in deep learning, check out the following resources:\n\n* [Interpretable Machine Learning\" by Christoph Molnar](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/). A comprehensive guide to making machine learning models interpretable.\n* [Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00093). A detailed paper providing an extensive overview of XAI.\n* [LIME GitHub Repository](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime)\n* [SHAP GitHub Repository](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)\n* [A Survey on Attention Mechanisms in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.16775)\n\n# Concluding Thoughts 💭\n\nUnderstanding the \"black box\" of deep learning is crucial for fostering trust and ethical integration in real-world applications. Prioritising explainability along with accuracy lets us fully leverage the potential of deep learning, enhancing efficiency and ensuring the outcomes align with ethical standards. I am excited to hear your tips on tricks for understanding and interpretability of deep learning models!\n\n✨**Best Wishes!** ✨ \n\n*Citation: This post is written by me and is edited with the help of ChatGPT.*\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](/discussions?tags=12101-Artificial+Intelligence)[Model Explainability](/discussions?tags=16070-Model+Explainability)[Exploratory Data Analysis](/discussions?tags=13201-Exploratory+Data+Analysis)[Beginner](/discussions?tags=13102-Beginner)[Deep Learning](/discussions?tags=13310-Deep+Learnin",

There are a lot resources other than these, you can also refer to those based on your convenience. The best way to learn is by doing. So don't try to overlearn at first. Take the minimum idea about topics and jump into a project and iterate the process. You will learn topics as well as you would have projects to showcase also.

        "content": "Setting up your data science environment involves installing Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and other essential tools that will be the backbone of your projects. This is a series, so every *few days* I plan to release new content and how-to guides to enrich your journey.\n\n# Installing Python\n\n* First, visit the [Python website](https://python.org) and download the latest version of Python for your operating system.\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F19197548%2Fdd96da875db6158adde51c0bb8c61558%2FScreen_Shot_2020-07-16_at_11.webp?generation=1711139286365103&alt=media)\n* Next, run the installer and follow the instructions. Ensure you check the box that says “Add Python to PATH” during installation to make Python accessible from the command line.\n\n# Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks\n\nJupyter Notebooks provide an interactive coding environment, allowing you to combine live code, visualizations, and markdown notes in a single document.\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F19197548%2Faee847b76632a98a63527738d7222f6b%2F02_new_notebook.webp?generation=1711139504098043&alt=media)\n\n* Open your command line (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS and Linux) and install Jupyter using Python's package manager pip:\n\n\n```\npip install notebook\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n* After installation, run the following command in your command line to start Jupyter Notebook\n\n\n```\njupyter notebook\ncontent\\_copy\n```\nThis command will open Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser, ready for you to start creating new notebooks.\n\n# Basic Setup\n\nCreate a dedicated folder on your computer for your data science projects. This will help you keep your datasets, scripts, and notebooks organized.\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F19197548%2Ff19f953c0e7434b4b6a5150277ca60d3%2Fpython-virtual-envs1.webp?generation=1711139586853920&alt=media)\n\n* Based on my previous experience, it’s a good practice to use virtual environments for your projects to manage dependencies efficiently. You can create a virtual environment using:\n\n\n```\npython -m venv myenv\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n* Next, install the core libraries for data analysis and visualization. With your virtual environment activated, install pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn using pip:\n\n\n```\npip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n# My advice\n\n* Familiarize yourself with the Jupyter Notebook interface. Practice creating new notebooks, writing and executing code, and using markdown for notes.\n* Consider installing Git for version control and collaboration. Git allows you to track changes, revert to previous states, and collaborate with others on projects.\n* Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore additional tools and libraries that can help with your specific needs, such as scikit-learn for machine learning, or TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning projects.\n\nDon’t hesitate to experiment with your setup, and remember, the best way to learn is by doing ☺️\n\n\n\n---\n\nIf you learnt something, don’t forget to drop an upvote to show your support. Additionally, if you have any comments or suggestions, make sure you put them in the comments.\n\nThanks for reading and follow me [@sahirmaharajj](https://www.kaggle.com/sahirmaharajj) for daily tips.",

        "content": "In the ever-evolving landscape of technology, StackOverflow, once the pinnacle for developers seeking answers, faced a formidable challenge with the emergence of generative AI products like ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, etc. What appeared as a threat soon transformed into an opportunity, showcasing StackOverflow's resilience and adaptability amidst technological disruption.\n\nDuring its golden age, StackOverflow stood unchallenged as the go-to platform for developers worldwide. However, the landscape shifted with the rise of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, which posed a significant challenge to StackOverflow's dominance. The platform experienced a decline in popularity, leading to a noticeable drop in user engagement and posting activity.\n\nResponding to this existential threat, StackOverflow initially implemented a reactionary measure by banning all generative AI. This move, while perhaps driven by a fear of obsolescence or a misunderstanding of AI's potential, reflected the initial resistance to change.\n\nHowever, StackOverflow quickly recognized the need for a strategic shift. Within a remarkably short span of seven months, the company reversed its stance, lifting the AI ban and introducing OverflowAI, a groundbreaking initiative that embraced generative AI technology.\n\nThe decision to integrate AI into its platform marked a pivotal moment for StackOverflow. With OverflowAI, the platform underwent a remarkable transformation, leveraging the power of AI to enhance user experience and functionality:\n\n1. **Enhanced Search Functionality**: The search feature, powered by generative AI, underwent a significant upgrade, delivering more accurate and relevant search results, thereby improving the overall quality of user interactions.\n2. **Virtual Assistant Integration**: A virtual assistant was seamlessly integrated into the platform, assisting users in formulating precise and detailed questions, thus facilitating more effective knowledge exchange and problem-solving.\n3. **IDE Integration**: Recognizing the diverse needs of developers, StackOverflow introduced an OverflowAI plugin for Visual Studio, enabling developers to seamlessly access StackOverflow's vast repository of knowledge directly from their integrated development environment (IDE), streamlining the development workflow.\n\nStackOverflow's journey serves as a testament to the importance of adaptability in navigating technological disruptions. Rather than resisting change, StackOverflow embraced innovation, demonstrating the value of reassessment, adaptation, and adoption in staying relevant and competitive in a rapidly evolving landscape.\n\nIn conclusion, StackOverflow's transition from perceiving generative AI as a threat to embracing it as an opportunity underscores the transformative power of strategic evolution. By embracing technological advancements, StackOverflow not only revitalized its platform but also reaffirmed its position as a pioneering force in the developer community. As we continue to witness the relentless march of technological progress, StackOverflow's journey serves as a guiding beacon, inspiring organizations to embrace change and harness innovation to thrive in the face of uncertainty.\n\n[Artificial Intelligence](/discussions?tags=12101-Artificial+Intelligence)[Online Communities](/discussions?tags=16489-Online+Communitie",

        "content": "Hi Kagglers,\n\n**Recently [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) released a feature [schedule notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/284587) to schedule your notebooks to run automatically**. Using this, you can schedule your notebook to run daily/weekly/monthly and likewise any datasets that are created from scheduled notebook outputs can be set to automatically update whenever a new version of the notebook is saved. Furthermore, you can also schedule your notebooks to rerun whenever the datasets they are attached to get updated.\n\n### How do I use scheduled updates?\n\n1. In the settings menu of the notebook editor, schedule the notebook to update either daily, weekly, monthly, or in response to the underlying dataset getting updated.\n2. In the metadata section of a dataset that was created directly from a Kaggle Notebook Output File, select \"**Keep dataset in sync with new notebook versions**\".\n\nSome limitations include:\n\n* Only **CPU** notebooks can be scheduled (not GPU/TPU).\n* **5 Private** and **15 Public** notebooks can be scheduled at any given time.\n* Schedules expire after a **maximum** of **10 runs** after which they need to be reset.\n* For **dataset update triggers** , scheduled notebooks run at most once per day.\n\n### Why do we need the scheduled updates?\n\nThere are plenty of datasets which update on a daily or weekly or monthly basis, and previously notebooks depending on these datasets had to be re-run manually every time that the underlying datasets were updated. For example , the [USA COVID-19 Vaccinations](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations) dataset updates daily and notebook authors may want to schedule their notebooks to run every time that a new dataset version is published. Likewise, you can schedule notebooks to update on their own [even if they are not attached to any underlying datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/climatic-eye-of-isci-disaster-tracking-panel).\n\n**You can also use this feature to automatically re-run notebooks that create, maintain, and update new datasets as well**. For example, the [Reliance Stock Prices with News Sentiment 📈](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/reliancestockandnewsdata)  dataset gets updated daily as a result of this [scheduled notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/reliance-stock-prices-with-news-sentiment) , fetching daily stock market data of Reliance and its daily news articles and creating a derived dataset which contains **news sentiment**. We can use this [generated dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/reliancestockandnewsdata) and study the stock market behavior and plan buy or sell strategies accordingly.\n\nLikewise, the [Kaggle Feedback Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/kaggle-feedback-comments) dataset gets updated daily as a result of [this scheduled notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/feedback-on-feature-launch-part-1-2-transform/notebook) (runs daily) , which is taking \"**Feature Launch/Update**\" forum posts from [meta-kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kaggle/meta-kaggle) dataset , transforming it and creating a new [derived dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/kaggle-feedback-comments) from the notebook outputs and [this notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/feedback-on-feature-launch-part-2-2-analyze) analyzing kagglers reaction on feature launches/updates forum posts , scheduled to run whenever the [Kaggle Feedback Comments](https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/kaggle-feedback-comments) dataset gets updated.\n\n### Community examples\n\n* Notebooks that are scheduled to re-run automatically in order to create, maintain, and keep updated a new or novel dataset\n\n\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/reliance-stock-prices-with-news-sentiment>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/feedback-on-feature-launch-part-1-2-transform>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/fetch-scrabble-data-from-woogles-io>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/process-scrabble-data-from-woogles-io>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/bertnieuwenampsen/webscraping-top-movies-by-moviemeter-nl>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/rajkumarl/ruddit-comment-extraction>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/philmod/astor-wine-sales>\n* Datasets that were created from the outputs of scheduled notebook runs\n\n\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/reliancestockandnewsdata/metadata>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/kaggle-feedback-comments/metadata>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/scrabble-data-from-wooglesio/metadata>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/raw-wooglesio-games/metadata>\n* Notebooks that are scheduled to re-run automatically in order to maintain an always-up-to-date data visualization\n\n\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/us-trending-videos-eda>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/yashvi/feedback-on-feature-launch-part-2-2-analyze>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis/kaggle-in-numbers>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/brsdincer/climatic-eye-of-isci-disaster-tracking-panel>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/martinmalandro/usa-tx-covid-19-tracking>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/eda-on-covid-panel-updated-weekly>\n* Notebooks that are scheduled to update whenever a new version of the underlying dataset is published\n\n\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/kalilurrahman/nasdaq-100-stock-visualization-eda>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/kalilurrahman/nasdaq-stock-price-prediction-using-lstm/notebook>\n\t+ <https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations",

That will help us to improve a lot.\n\n**Complexity**\\\n\n1) If i schedule a notebook if i will get an error i should informed over mail. if notebook's run is successful i should informed over email. Managing a pipeline of notebooks, especially when they have interdependencies, can become complex. Ensuring that notebooks are executed in the correct order and that data is passed effectively between them can be challenging.\\\n\n**Debugging**\\\n\n2)Debugging errors or issues in scheduled or triggered notebooks can be more challenging than debugging notebooks run interactively. Errors may not be immediately apparent, and diagnosing problems in a scheduled context can be time-consuming.\\\n\n**Version Control**\\\n\n3)Keeping track of changes and versions in a pipeline of notebooks can be more challenging than working with standalone notebooks. Maintaining proper version control and ensuring consistency across the pipeline is essential. **Connection with something like GIT Repo will be highly appreciated and much reliable**\\\n\n**API Limitations:**\\\n\n4)Kaggle's APIs have usage limitations. If your pipeline relies heavily on Kaggle's APIs for data or other interactions, you may run into API usage limits.",

                        "content": "Hi [@parthkapgate](https://www.kaggle.com/parthkapgate),\n\nYour question is quite valid and not stupid at all. Scheduled updates and automatic reruns of notebooks can be incredibly useful for keeping datasets and visualizations up to date, but when it comes to predictive models, especially for stock prices, it does introduce some challenges and potential pitfalls.\n\n**Model Evaluation:** As you pointed out, if a model is constantly updating itself with the latest data, it becomes difficult to assess its true predictive power. Ideally, you would want to train your model on a set of data, make predictions for a future period, and then compare those predictions to the actual outcomes once they are known. This helps you to understand how well your model is likely to perform in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Overfitting:** Continually updating the model with new data carries the risk of overfitting the model to recent trends, which may not be representative of the longer-term trend. This can result in a model that is too sensitive to recent fluctuations and may not generalize well to future data.\n\n**Manipulation:** As you noted, there is also a risk that someone could manipulate their model to match recent data too closely, either intentionally or unintentionally. This could result in a model that appears to have high predictive accuracy but actually performs poorly on new, unseen data.\n\n**To mitigate these risks, it is important to have a robust model evaluation process in place. This could involve:**\n\n* Splitting your data into a training set, a validation set, and a test set. The model is trained on the training set, its hyperparameters are tuned using the validation set, and its final performance is evaluated on the test set.\n* Using cross-validation techniques, such as k-fold cross-validation, to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the data.\n* Regularly assessing the model's performance on new data and comparing its predictions to actual outcomes. This can help to identify any deterioration in the model's performance and make necessary adjustments.\n* Being cautious about how frequently you update your model and carefully considering whether new data genuinely contributes to improving the model's predictive power.\n\nRemember, it's always important to strike a balance between updating your model to reflect new data and avoiding the risks of overfitting and manipulation. As a beginner, it's great that you are thinking about these issues and considering the potential implications of automatically updating your models.",

Popular options include Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or cloud-based platforms like Databricks or AWS Sagemaker.\n\nConfigure your environment: Install the software and dependencies required to run notebooks. This can be Python, Jupyter, and whatever library or package you use in your notebook.\n\nCreating your notebooks: Create notebooks with the code you want to execute as part of your pipeline. These notebooks should be designed to run independently and perform specific tasks or analysis.\n\nDefine Triggers and Schedules : Define the execution of events or schedules that will trigger your notebooks. Triggers can be events such as data arriving at a specific location, API calls, or user action. Schedules can be defined so that the directory is run at specific times or for specific periods of time (e.g. daily, weekly, monthly).\n\nSet up automation: Depending on the platform you choose, there are different ways to automate notebooks. Here are a few options:\n\nJupyter Notebook/JupyterLab: Use cron or integrated scheduling tools such as an external job scheduler (e.g., papermill with cron) to schedule the notebook's execution.\\\n\nDatabricks: Use Databricks Jobs or Databricks Automation to schedule and trigger notebook processing.\\\n\nAWS Sagemaker: Set AWS Step Functions or AWS Lambda functions to schedule and trigger notebook operations.\\\n\nConfigure notebook functions: Set settings for notebook functions, including input parameters, environment variables, and dependencies. Ensure notebooks are configured to store output files or communicate results as needed.\n\nMonitoring and troubleshooting: Use logging and monitoring mechanisms to track the performance of your notes",

By using scheduled updates, you can ensure that your notebooks run automatically at specified intervals or in response to dataset updates. Here's how you can set up and utilize this feature:\n\nSchedule Notebooks:\\\n\nOpen the notebook editor and go to the settings menu.\\\n\nChoose the desired frequency for your notebook updates: daily, weekly, monthly, or triggered by dataset updates.\\\n\nNote that currently only CPU notebooks can be scheduled, and there are limits on the number of scheduled notebooks (5 Private, 15 Public).\n\nKeep Datasets in Sync:\\\n\nIf you have created a dataset directly from a Kaggle Notebook Output File, you can select the option to keep the dataset in sync with new notebook versions.\\\n\nThis ensures that whenever a new version of the notebook is saved, the dataset will be automatically updated.\n\nIt's important to be aware of some limitations:\\\n\nScheduled notebooks on Kaggle run at most once per day for dataset update triggers.\\\n\nScheduled notebooks have a maximum of 10 runs before they need to be reset.\\\n\nGPU/TPU notebooks cannot be scheduled at this time.\n\nScheduled updates can be beneficial in various scenarios:\\\n\nAutomatically re-running notebooks that create, maintain, and update datasets.\\\n\nKeeping data visualizations always up-to-date by scheduling notebook runs.\\\n\nUpdating notebooks whenever a new version of the underlying dataset is published.\\\n\nBy utilizing scheduled and triggered notebooks, you can streamline your data analysis workflows, keep your datasets and visualizations up-to-date, and automate repetitive tasks. You can refer to the provided examples in the message to get inspiration and see how other Kagglers are leveraging this feature. Remember to consider the specific requirements and limitations mentioned above when setting up your pipeline. Happy automating!",

The ability to plan notebooks to run automatically on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis saves users precious time and effort because they would otherwise have to run their notebooks manually every time the underlying datasets are changed. Furthermore, the ability to automatically update derived datasets and trigger notebook re-runs based on dataset modifications provides another degree of ease and automation to the data science workflow. This tool is certain to boost data scientists' productivity on Kaggle and assist them in achieving their objectives more efficiently.",

However, there are certain limitations to this feature. Only CPU notebooks can be scheduled, and there is a limit of 5 private and 15 public notebooks that can be scheduled at any given time. Schedules also expire after a maximum of 10 runs, and for dataset update triggers, scheduled notebooks run at most once per day.",

Because this field uses jupyter notebooks extensively I started collecting my code snippets there, but I want to pick your brains and suggestions on how best to do this (I know these tens of lines of code will grow 🤣). It feels jupyter notebooks aren't for this task (no hyperlinks to sections). \n\nDo you document your How-TO notes on jupyter notebooks? Word? Some other format allowing you to jump into subsections (like with an index) but editing these just as easily along the way?

        "content": "In the field of artificial intelligence, this is most important step for any project in AI, ML, DL, NLP.\n\nAnswering the simplest question “What is data preprocessing?”\\\n\nProcessing the dataset in such a way that we could feed it to our model, so that our AI model learns best from dataset and helps in further predictions.\n\nAn AI model, being complex, is a mathematical equation which understands numbers, built upon with many mathematical tools, concepts and genius ideas.\n\nWhy data preprocessing?\\\n\nAsking “Why” simplifies most of the learning process.\n\nDatasets in the real world are not that ideal to be directly feeded into a AI model. Simply assume as they are not ready.\n\nLets take an example of titanic dataset.\\\n\nProblem statement : To build a predictive model that answers the question: “What sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data.\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F15856017%2Fec527b94c9830990516f59e68022ea65%2FScreenshot%202024-03-24%20170225.png?generation=1711304214990052&alt=media)\n\nNow answer my questions :\n\n1) What can a AI model do with data like PassengerId, Name, Ticket number?\\\n\nAnswer : Well the answer is very simple, AI model does nothing to with this data. Because these does not decide whether the person survives or not.\n\n2) If you see “Cabin” column you could see some entries as “NaN”. It simply means that the value is missing. Now what my AI model should do since the value is missing ?\\\n\nAnswer : Yes, the answer is to handle it. But my AI model don’t know how to handle it. Handling solely depends up on the use case. We should handle those in the preprocessing step.\n\n3) Look at the columns “Sex”, “Embarked”. They are filled with characters, string, or may be some other unrelaible datatype. Does my AI model know how to use such data for predictions?\\\n\nAnswer : Absolutely no, AI model is a mathematical equation. It understands the terms only of mathematical importance.\\\n\nWhat’s the solution?\\\n\nConvert the categorical columns to numerical columns. It is as simple as that.\n\n4) If I have the dataset with less number of passengers like may be 200 or 300. Is it enough to train our AI model to help with further predictions?\\\n\nThe answer is that it depends. Usually we need a many datapoints to train our AI model. It also includes the step to artificially generate new datapoints. You will know about it if you follow me.\n\nAnd there are many aspects of feature engineering.\n\n#### Major steps of Preprocessing\n\n1. Load datasets and decide which columns not at all required for our use case. Drop them from dataset. I call this step as “Feature selection 1”.\n2. Determine the numerical columns and categorical columns.\n3. Exploratory data analysis is most important step of preprocessing. I call this step as “Know more about your dataset”.\n4. Handle missing values by imputing mean, median, mode or any other value in place of “NaN”.\n5. Upsample the dataset if it is unbalanced. Artificially generate more datapoints if needed.\n6. Encode all the categorical features with the techniques like nominal encoding, ordinal encoding, target guided encoding.\n7. Feature selection 2 : Remove the features on the basis of variance, correlation and there are many more methods.\n8. Finally scale the dataset. The dataset is now ready to be feeded to AI Model.\n\nActually there may be some steps included in between. I have discussed the major steps. Exactly what to do in preprocessing depends on project to project and how well you have done EDA.\n\n#### Key takeaways\n\nUnderstand what is Preprocessing?\\\n\nMajor steps of Preprocessing.\\\n\nYou had tried to think about the answers of the questions I have asked.",

Like, if your dataset is called \"my\\_model\\_results,\" change it to \"my\\_model\\_results\\_v1\" or add the date to the name. Then, make a new dataset with the original name, \"my\\_model\\_results.\" This way, you keep the old version with a new name and have a fresh dataset for the current run. If possible, try adding the new results to the original dataset instead of replacing them. This should help you keep track of all your model versions without losing any data.",

        "content": "![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F11611801%2F3eb1781bacbb9f1ee703e275f50efb64%2F3.png?generation=1710697065113240&alt=media)\n\nI just finished the first chapter of the book \"Feature Engineering for Machine Learning: Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists,\" and I would like to discuss some thoughts I had along the way.\n\nI usually create a function[1] to test a handful of models, or even apply auto-ml. When evaluating the score on both training and test data, we can infer a series of things, let's focus on the fact that the features chosen for the problem may simply not have much impact.\n\nThis is a problem if you're thinking in a data-centric analysis; however, I prefer to take this first step because I understand that if the score doesn't surpass a mere guess (50%), it leads me to believe that the features I have at hand do not reflect the nature of my problem (that is, they are inadequate). Therefore, I return to the step of selecting features and apply methods such as binning, PCA… and all sorts of other strategies that I continue to learn more about. After this stage, I use random search and then grid search to save resources (first I test a sampling, select, and then test all possible ones). This process makes me proud to know that despite the mistakes, I am beginning to understand machine learning, although it may seem obvious, I believe it is a lifelong work, isn't it? It's not about models, I would say. It's about interaction, testing, reformulation, and organization so that tests are possible and controlled (like a backlog).\n\nI conclude by saying that, not knowing where to start, first understand your problem (in competitions, using other people's notebooks is something I value highly on the platform), then using a framework that allows you to interact with the data, add a feature selection step, and then start your work in earnest.\n\n\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n[1] Framework for testing the models\n\n\n```\n def train\\_eval(models, X\\_train, X\\_test, y\\_train, y\\_test):\n\n    numeric_features = X.select_dtypes(exclude=['object']).columns\n    numeric_transformer = Pipeline(\n        steps=[(\"scaler\", RobustScaler())])\n\n    cat_features = X.select_dtypes(include=['object']).columns\n    cat_transformer = Pipeline(\n        steps=[(\"encoder\", OneHotEncoder())])\n\n    preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(\n        transformers=[\n            (\"num\", numeric_transformer, numeric_features), \n            ('cat', cat_transformer, cat_features)])\n\n    model_score = {} \n    for name, model in models.items():\n\n        clf = Pipeline(steps=[(\"preprocessor\", preprocessor),\n                              (\"classifier\", model)]) # models w/ fe\n\n        fit_model = clf.fit(X_train, y_train)\n        model_score[name] = fit_model.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n    return f'# {model\\_score}'\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n[2] Resources I read to write\\\n\n[Data-Centric Approach vs Model-Centric Approach in Machine Learning](https://neptune.ai/blog/data-centric-vs-model-centric-machine-learning)\n\n[Feature Selection Methods and How to Choose Them](https://neptune.ai/blog/feature-selection-methods)\n\n\n\n---\n\nThank you for coming this far. The opinion above solely reflects my perspective on what I have studied, without any intention of establishing absolute truths. As part of the learning process, I acknowledge the risk of making mistakes, but at the moment, I am confident in my words, :).\n\nI strongly recommend reading the mentioned book. Reading is my superpower, I usually read hundreds of books per year and have frameworks that help me keep relevant information in one place where I can grasp the book's idea in seconds. I'll still talk about this because I consider that the most positive aspect of a library, as Humberto Eco well said, is the unread books (conversation for another time). Finally, I hate anything that borders on self-help, and I don't always read fiction despite having my favorites.",

Sin embargo, me siento un poco abrumada y no estoy segura de por dónde empezar. Me encantaría pedirles consejos y orientación sobre cómo puedo comenzar a utilizar eficazmente RStudio para el análisis de datos.\n\nMis objetivos principales son aprender a manipular datos, realizar visualizaciones y eventualmente realizar análisis estadísticos más avanzados. Ya instalé R y RStudio en mi computadora, pero me gustaría saber cuáles son los recursos recomendados, libros, tutoriales o cursos en línea que podrían ayudarme a adquirir habilidades básicas y avanzadas en RStudio.\n\nAdemás, ¿existen algunas prácticas recomendadas que debo seguir para mejorar mi eficiencia y evitar errores comunes mientras trabajo en RStudio?",

We also also to learn math and statistics to be able to use R effectively. We have to know what to do and why we do it. \n\n**Courses**\\\n\nHarvard University's *Data Science Professional Certificate*\\\n\n<https://www.edx.org/certificates/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science>\n\nMIT's *The Analytics Edge*\\\n\n<https://www.edx.org/learn/analytics/massachusetts-institute-of-technology-the-analytics-edge>\n\nDuke University's *Data Science with R Specialization* - This is statistics course that uses R\\\n\n<https://www.coursera.org/specializations/statistics>\n\nStanford's *Statistical Learning* - machine learning course\\\n\n<https://www.edx.org/learn/statistics/stanford-university-statistical-learning>\n\n**Books**\\\n\n*R for Data Science* <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>\n\n*Introduction to Data Science* & *Advanced Data Science* - Textbooks for the first course listed above\\\n\n<https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook-part-1/>\n\nAn Introduction to Statistical Learning - textbook for the Stanford Statistical Learning course\\\n\n<https://www.statlearning.com/>\n\n**Tutorials**\\\n\nJulia Silge's blog - also on YouTube\\\n\n<https://juliasilge.com/>\n\nDavid Robinson's YouTube channel\\\n\n<https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeiiqmVK07qhY-wvg3IZiZQ>\n\nThe are many, many other R courses, books, tutorials, videos, and websites available online. Learn to use a Google search to find whatever you want to learn, to know, or need help with. Google is much quicker than asking questions in discussion forums. \n\nAs a new R user, most of your errors will be due to misspelling, mis-capitalization, and mis-punctuation. Errors are part of learning. We can Google R's error messages and find answers in seconds. You also have R help within R to explain function parameters, required inputs, and the output, with examples. R Help is also available online. \n\nThere is enough material listed above to keep you busy for a couple of years. ",

                "content": "I suggest the below path [@taranum](https://www.kaggle.com/taranum) \n\n## Foundation\n\n1. Firstly learn\\*\\* SQL and one among R/ python\\*\\* to become familiar with data wrangling and visualization. This is a pre-requisite for all projects. You may learn numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly as a start-point. Also, focus on **Tableau/ Power BI** as visualization tools will help you with your upcoming interviews.\n\n## ML classical models\n\n1. Read ML text-books to know an algorithm, say linear regression. Then apply this algorithm on a Kaggle dataset and test your knowledge. You can replace the text book with YouTube video if you are comfortable watching YouTube to learn.\n2. Then proceed to the next algorithm and repeat step2\n3. Avoid deep learning algorithms till you get comfortable with ML algorithms\n4. Once you are familiar with all ML algorithms, participate in Kaggle starter competitions to get an end-to-end experience of an ML project. These include- \\\n\na. Titanic\\\n\nb. Spaceship Titanic\\\n\nc. Store Sales \\\n\nd. House Prices\n5. Post this step, proceed to Kaggle playground series- apply all your past knowledge and knowledge gained from public forums to try and compete in this series\n\n## Deep learning\n\n1. Once this is done, you may proceed to deep learning. You may follow the below path-\\\n\na. Learn one among tensorflow/ pytorch including data preparation and metrics\\\n\nb. Subscribe to a course (say, the Andrew Ng's DL Specialization)\\\n\nc. Practise your knowledge on Kaggle datasets and past competition data\\\n\nd. Post your solutions here and link to github\n2. Proceed to complex deep learning models like LLM and GenAI at the end once you get proficient with all simple models. Rushing into this genre without clear fundamentals will harm you rather than doing good.\n3. Try and build code pipelines that can be reused across assignments- take the help of GenAI tools like Mistral, Gemma, ChatGPT for the same. Having and using your own pipeline is best for upcoming competitions.\n\n## Some useful resources\n\n1. YouTube channels- Krish Naik, Statquest, Abhishek Thakur, Edureka (coding + ML)\n2. Freecodecamp, Datacamp, W3School (coding)\n3. Courses- \\\n\na. Kaggle courses\\\n\nb. ML and DL Specialization (Coursera) and IBM ML Specialization \\\n\nc. NLP Specialization (Coursera)\\\n\nd. Computer Vision nanodegree (Udacity)\\\n\ne. GAN Specialization (Coursera)\n\nRemember to persevere and dedicate at least 30-60 minutes per day for ML and associated tasks. Success and progression will surely follow suit. \\\n\nAll the best!",

The focus of my work was not just on the algorithm's implementation, but also on visualizing how the decision boundary evolves with each epoch.\n\nThis visualization aims to help beginners understand the mechanics behind the perceptron and how it gradually learns to separate different classes. I'd love to get your feedback, or any questions you might have. Your insights would be greatly appreciated.\n\nHere's the link to my notebook:\\\n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/code/emadmakhlouf/decision-boundary-visualization>\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts and discussions!\n\n[Data Visualization](/discussions?tags=13208-Data+Visualization)[Binary Classification](/discussions?tags=14201-Binary+Classification)[NumPy](/discussions?tags=16609-NumP",

But when dealing with data from multiple sources, VLOOKUP becomes your hero! We'll explore this champion in the next chapter of your data analysis journey.\n\n\n> \n> ## VLOOKUP: The Data Matchmaker\n> \n> \n> \n\nConquered the world of Pivot Tables? Now, get ready to tackle data from multiple sources with the mighty VLOOKUP formula! \n\n**Imagine you have customer data in one spreadsheet and product details in another.** VLOOKUP allows you to seamlessly merge this data, creating a unified and powerful dataset for analysis.\n\n**Think of VLOOKUP as a data matchmaker.** It searches for a specific value (lookup value) in one table (table array) and then retrieves a corresponding value from a different column (column index return) within the same table.\n\n**The VLOOKUP Formula Breakdown:**\n\nThe magic of VLOOKUP lies in its four arguments:\n\n* **LOOKUP\\_VALUE:** The value you're searching for in the first table.\n* **TABLE\\_ARRAY:** The table containing the data you want to search.\n* **COL\\_INDEX\\_RETURN:** The column index of the value you want to retrieve from the second table.\n* **RANGE\\_LOOKUP (Optional):** Set to FALSE for exact matches (highly recommended!).\n\n**Bonus Tip:** Leverage named references for tables to improve readability and reduce formula errors. \n\n**Key Considerations:**\n\n* **The Search Column:** The value you're searching for should ideally be in the first column of the target table.\n* **File Location:** When referencing data from another Excel file, ensure both files are in the same directory to avoid errors.\n\n**Ready to unleash the power of VLOOKUP?** I'll guide you through a step-by-step example, demonstrating how to merge data from separate tables using this powerful formula.\n\nAbsolutely, here's a concise way to summarize the top 3 VLOOKUP mistakes:\n\n**Taming VLOOKUP: Avoiding the Pitfalls**\n\nEven VLOOKUP masters encounter challenges. Here are the top 3 mistakes to steer clear of:\n\n1. **Search Column Mismatch:** Ensure the value you're searching for resides in the **first column** of the target table. Otherwise, your VLOOKUP might struggle to find the right match.\n2. **Missing Dollar Signs:** Dollar signs are crucial for absolute cell references in formulas. Inaccurate references can lead to the dreaded \"#NA\" error, indicating a missing value.\n3. **Fuzzy Matches vs. Exact Matches:** By default, VLOOKUP performs approximate matches. For guaranteed accuracy, always set the last argument (`RANGE_LOOKUP`) to **FALSE**, ensuring an exact match for your lookup value.\n\nYou'll be well on your way to VLOOKUP mastery by avoiding these common pitfalls!\n\n\n> \n> ## Conquering Common Excel Errors: Your Troubleshooting Toolkit\n> \n> \n> \n\nEven the most seasoned data analysts encounter errors in Excel. But fear not! Mastering error identification and rectification is key to maintaining data accuracy and efficiency.\n\n**Understanding Errors: The Key to Resolution**\n\nThe first step to conquering errors is understanding their root cause. Some common culprits include:\n\n* **Incorrect Referencing:** Mistakes in cell references can lead to unexpected results. Double-check your formulas to ensure accuracy.\n* **Data Format Mismatches:** Inconsistent data formats (e.g., text vs. numbers) can confuse Excel. Ensure your data is formatted appropriately for the intended calculations.\n\n**Your Excel Troubleshooting Toolbox:**\n\n* **Evaluate Formula (Formulas Tab):** This feature allows you to step through each part of a complex formula, pinpointing exactly where the error occurs.\n* **Error Checking (Formulas Tab):** This handy tool scans your worksheet for potential errors, highlighting areas that might require attention.\n* **Show Formulas (Formulas Tab):** Sometimes, visualizing the formulas behind the data can be incredibly helpful in identifying errors or understanding complex calculations.\n\n**Remember:** By mastering these troubleshooting techniques, you'll transform Excel errors from roadblocks into opportunities for learning and improvement.\n\n\n> \n> ## Wrapping Up: Your Data Analysis Arsenal\n> \n> \n> \n\nCongratulations!

These courses also give you the chance to apply your newly learnt skills to entry level competitions such as the Titanic Survival Classification challenge.\n\nI’d also recommend studying relevant areas of mathematics such as linear algebra, calculus, statistics, and probability. These areas are the foundations of machine learning and will help your understanding in the area. There are plenty of great resources available for free on YouTube.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nPhil",

These are basics for a Data Scientist.\n2. **Excel in Python or R**: To run your vehicle, you must have to be proficient in one of Programming language used for Data Science tasks. **Python or R**, it is your choice, but must excel in one of them.\n3. **Domain Knowledge**: To get more inside about any case study you must have to gain expertise in Domain Specific Knowledge. For example, if are building a prediction system for a Shoe stope, you must have to know about how the shoe business runs. It will help you to do more in context decision.\n4. **Data Wrangling and Cleaning**: In most of the cases for data gathering, where human are involved, there is greater chance of errors. So, be reading for data wrangling and cleaning. Even for auto-generated data, a huge effort is required to clean and rebuild the data to make it useful for Machine Learning algorithm.\n5. **Data Visualization**: To present the data to user, data visualization plays a crucial part, so be proficient in data visualization. There are tons of options available in both Python and R. Learn and practice matlpotlib, seaborn, and plotly like libraries.\n\n[Data Storytelling](/discussions?tags=17076-Data+Storytelling)[Data Visualization](/discussions?tags=13208-Data+Visualization)[Python](/discussions?tags=16639-Python)[Exploratory Data Analysis](/discussions?tags=13201-Exploratory+Data+Analysi",

Most of us who haven't any professional working experience yet (Since most of us haven't graduated yet and explored the actual field) so in this case gaining domain knowledge on any specific area first we have to identify the niche that excites a person. Since we are not involved in any specific company/domain yet, I think it becomes tough to figuring out the specific field so we work on in-general-projects (unless a person is blessed with knowledge what specific niche he/she wants to work in future). So I'm seeking guidance regarding what are your say on the way of gaining domain-knowledge for students who are not exposed with professional experiences yet. ",

And start as the order I mentioned.\\\n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas>\\\n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning>\\\n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering>\n3. Now you will be ready to train models. \\\n\nWatch any video on youtube. Just type \"How to train ML models?\". You can watch any of those.\n\nActually this is for a newbie. There are many aspects to learn in Machine learning.",

These special tools, often found in `IPython`, go beyond standard Python code. They act as shortcuts and helpers, boosting your productivity. With magic commands, you can streamline tasks, measure performance, manage your coding environment, and even work with other languages – all within your `IPython` session. \n\n**The Wizardry of Python's Magic Commands** 🧙‍♂️🐍\\\n\nI am telling you some of the most popular magic commands in Python. I'll use clear examples to show you how they work and how they can make your Python life easier.\n\n# **1. Line Magic Commands:**\n\n## **a) `%time`**\n\n* Measures the execution time of a single Python statement.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%time result = sum(range(1000000))\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **b) `%timeit`**\n\n* Measures the average execution time of a Python statement over multiple runs.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%timeit result = sum(range(1000000))\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **c) `%run`**\n\n* Executes a Python script file in the IPython session.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%run my_script.py\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **d) `%load`**\n\n* Loads code from an external script into the current IPython session.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%load my_module.py\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **e) `%reset`**\n\n* Resets the namespace by deleting all variables.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%reset -f\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **f) `%pdb`**\n\n* Automatically activates the Python debugger (pdb) upon encountering an exception.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%pdb\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n# **2. Cell Magic Commands:**\n\n## **a) `%%time`**\n\n* Measures the execution time of an entire cell.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%%time\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    sum(range(10000))\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **b) `%%timeit`**\n\n* Measures the average execution time of a Python statement or expression in a cell.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%%timeit\nfor _ in range(1000):\n    sum(range(10000))\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **c) `%%writefile`**\n\n* Writes the contents of a cell to a file.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%%writefile my_file.txt\nThis is a sample text.\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **d) `%%capture`**\n\n* Captures the output of a cell, optionally storing it in a variable.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%%capture captured_output\nprint(\"This output is captured.\")\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **e) `%%html`**\n\n* Renders cell contents as HTML.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%%html\n<h1>This is rendered as HTML</h1>\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n## **f) `%%markdown`**\n\n* Renders cell contents as Markdown.\n* **Example:**\n\n\n```\n%%markdown\n**This** is rendered as Markdown.\ncontent\\_copy\n```\n# **Conclusion:**\n\nPython's magic commands serve as enchanting instruments, empowering programmers with remarkable capabilities to streamline their workflow. Through this exploration, I have uncovered the versatility and utility of these commands, enabling you to wield Python's magic with finesse and efficiency.\n\n# **References:**\n\n* IPython documentation: <https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>\n* Python documentation: <https://docs.python.org/>\n\n[Python](/discussions?tags=16639-Python)[IPython](/discussions?tags=16599-IPytho",
