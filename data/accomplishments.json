This is an essential and critical skill for any data science enthusiast, and I am very excited to take this step in my data science journey. 🚀\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F17651006%2Fb2c4fa631a8fb2aa168a6665f3b8eb10%2Fhsling%20-%20Data%20Cleaning.png?generation=1711422343643851&alt=media)\\\n\nAfter completing this course, I have an in-depth understanding and practical experience in data cleaning. I realized that data cleaning was not just a necessity as a pre-processing step, but a cornerstone of ensuring success in data analysis and machine learning projects. Clean, uncluttered data can significantly improve model accuracy and reliability\n\nI'm ready to apply what I've learned to more data science projects and continue to explore the other courses and competitions Kaggle has to offer. Data cleansing was just one step in the data science journey, but it opened up endless possibilities for me.",

The number of medals in the discussion area exceeded 400🎖️. Along the way, I gained a lot and learned a lot.\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F17651006%2F86d7d14620fb1ae36b4036aef65df36c%2F_20240325101353.png?generation=1711332856229368&alt=media)\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F17651006%2F1207f611832860d8b4e578e6d7ccbed2%2F_20240325101358.png?generation=1711332868839210&alt=media)\\\n\nThis 83-day journey is just the beginning, and I look forward to participating in more competitions, exploring more data sets, and in-depth communication with community friends🤝.\\\n\nI hope my experience can inspire everyone to create more possibilities on Kaggle✨",

I personally have held mostly the same strategy since I started on Kaggle. I compete in competitions and then I look at the gold medal finishers' solutions with a fine tooth comb. My goal is to understand what led them to make the decisions nobody else saw. What did they do that I didn't think to try. For example, in this notebook, I get my first competition Gold medal. \n\n<https://www.kaggle.com/code/cody11null/14th-place-gold-cat-lgb-refit>\n\nThe core trick in this competition was refitting the model after some time had passed rather than only fitting the model at the time of submission. Check this notebook out and let me know what you think? What do you believe is the key to growth on Kaggle? \n\nI will also note, I put this post in the accomplishments category because I have heard that is where notebooks go now? If I am wrong about this let me know! Happy Kaggling! ",

Public work is there for one to study and incorporate some ideas if one think they are beneficial, not blindly forking and changing stuff like ensemble weights/hyperparameters to improve the score.\n\nThinking out of the box, to have an edge over other competitors is a must to differentiate amongst the crowd of close scores in a Kaggle competition.",

Thank you all so much for supporting me and my work and for teaching me so much! I certainly don't think of myself as particularly gifted. I have only been studying data science at a deeper level for about 4 years now. I have only been on kaggle for about 13 months. I fully believe that anyone can do it if they put their mind to it. Don't be afraid to start because you are probably better equipped than me!

        "content": "Hello, Kaggle Community!\n\nI'm happy to share a personal milestone. As 2024 started I vowed to help improve ML on tabular data (instead of getting lost in that LLM space). \n\nOne of the way to do so was to build my own competition. The competition is available here: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bench-tab-v1/discussion/467768> The goal is to provide a good benchmark for tabular models, replicating the paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.08815.pdf> from [@leogri](https://www.kaggle.com/leogri) . I hope it will help improve models but also our understanding of those 'black box' and what is driving their performance. Such a competition, accessible to the community helps fostering a spirit of collaboration and mutual growth.\n\nKey Highlights (so far):\n\n* **Competitions provides around 60 datasets**, partitioned in 4 categories (whether data and/or targets includes categoricals). I personally hope to see if we can get from data what is driving final performance.\n* **Metric** is improvement over a baseline, an ensemble of catboost.\n* It has been on-ongoing for 2 months and **there is still more than one month to run**.\n* Discussion: some interesting discussion about also on tabular data. Gbdts are by far the most used (because easier to use?).\n* **Baseline:** this discussion <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bench-tab-v1/discussion/467768> from [@carlmcbrideellis](https://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis) confirms initial findings. On untuned models:\n\nx **Catboost** is best out of the box. \\\n\nx Out of the box, **Lgbm** is 20x faster while retaining most of the performance. (or conversely catboost is 20x times slower for slightly better performance - not sure that comparison is entirely fair to lgbm)\\\n\nx Out of the box, **Xgboost**, despite significant improvements in its 2.0 version is lagging behind both in terms of performance and training time.\n\n* Current Top solution achieves a **10% overall improvement in loss reduction**. I wonder what is going on. (I suspect some feature engineering).\n* Community also shared notebooks: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bench-tab-v1> I personally would like to see more diverse baselines, notably on the NN side.\n\nThe journey is not finished:\n\n* First, the competition is still on-going. There is still a month to explore cutting edge technologies and make progress on the use of ML on tabular data. Feel free to participate, discuss, share insights. For this there is no better approach than participating: <https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bench-tab-v1>\n* I also intend to update the competition with our main findings. Your feedback, questions, and insights will be taken into account.\n* I am also considering getting co-hosts. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to help, more specifically if you are willing to help gather more datasets / help on communication to improve participation.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone who has been a part of this project, directly or indirectly. Your support, encouragement, and constructive criticism have been the driving forces behind tabular ML progress. Let's continue to push the boundaries of what's possible together.\n\nBest,\\\n\nLucas",

It was SO useful to do this as a favourite pastime and grow my career and data science knowledge! I would say I spent more than 75% of my spare time on Kaggle Competitions and learning more ML skills for the past 9 months.\n\nLooking forward for more! The need for skillsets involving LLMs is on the rise these days 😀. Aiming for the Competitions Grandmaster title next, will be tough but am absolutely up for the challenge!",

However, I never would have believed all that I have learned, the advancements in my career, and the friends that I have made. Today with the end of the Optiver competition I became a Competition Master. I feel like just yesterday I was learning the basics, I still often feel overwhelmed, but I just keep trying. Thank you all for making Kaggle the amazing experience that it is! And of course Happy Kaggling! \n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F13672938%2F17788fd8c2206f7b8871564d1c15f28b%2FCapture2.PNG?generation=1711131685160116&alt=media)\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F13672938%2Fd15dc46ed5141749f50cb33df72b3fc0%2FCapture.PNG?generation=1711131650596068&alt=media)",

This is a notable achievement for me, as I'm a humble data enthusiast who hopes to learn something new while playing with data and not a professional. Thanks to all the members of Kaggle community who helped me in this journey. That was fun 😄.\n\nCoincidentally, the same week I ran my first Marathon race. So, now I'm also a member of the not-so-big community of Marathon runners ( <0.5% of the population of Earth they say 😅). This has little to do with data science in general and Kaggle in particular. But I wanted to share.\n\nI'm happy to be here and let's keep going! ❤️\n\nFun, fun, fun, fun, fun!",

The Kaggle community is something, for sure! ❤️\n\nAbout the Marathon. I've never ran 42 km before the race, so I was a bit cautious and didn't run full speed - and that was a good decision. I find the full M is much more challenging than HM in terms of endurance. It is a long race, so fatigue is real. I've running for 3 years and I had only 1 month of slight training before the race. That was enough for me to run the race but was not enough to show the best results.\n\nI also found the VO2Max projection to be optimistic. My projection for the M was 3h 50m. I did it in 4h 27m. Maybe, because VO2Max takes in regards only the oxygen metabolism. And in my case, the biggest challenges were the knees and the legs. They weren't prepared properly for such long-distance races and started to hurt after the 15th km. \n\nI also didn't know what to expect and tried to save energy for the last. Maybe, with the proper training and knowing the pace for M, I would make under 4h, but 3:50 - is way too optimistic. \n\nFor the next M, I would give myself 3-6 months of special training. And I also would include 1-2 long-distance runs in my weekly routine. ",

However, computer vision, as a branch of machine learning, has always been full of mystery to me. \"How can pictures and videos be converted into data that machines can understand?\" This question has always troubled me. Fortunately, I found a computer vision course on Kaggle, which not only started my learning journey, but also completely changed my view on this field.\\\n\n![](https://www.googleapis.com/download/storage/v1/b/kaggle-forum-message-attachments/o/inbox%2F17651006%2F17d1533e86e29b9134ab3ea5e5b828e1%2Fhslingkrs%20-%20Computer%20Vision.png?generation=1710983401365956&alt=media)\\\n\nFinally, I look forward to applying what I learned in future projects to solve more problems.",
