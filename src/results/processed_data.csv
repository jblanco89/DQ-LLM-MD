Hello everyone       Today  I want to share with you my journey on Kaggle    . It is a journey that is both challenging and growing. In the past 83 days  I insisted on logging in to Kaggle every day. Not only did I participate in 11 competitions     and won two competition bronze medals  but I also won three silver medals in data sets      and one silver medal in notebooks    . The number of medals in the discussion area exceeded 400       . Along the way  I gained a lot and learned a lot.       URL       URL  This 83-day journey is just the beginning  and I look forward to participating in more competitions  exploring more data sets  and in-depth communication with community friends    .  I hope my experience can inspire everyone to create more possibilities on Kaggle	Celebrating 83 days of continuous loginâtwo competition medals, three silver medals for data sets, one silver medal for notebook code, and 400 medals for discussion forums		2024-03-25T02:14:30+00:00	10	wolfmedal	Expert		11	0	486453	accomplishments	['General']

Hi all  I had a thought. Most of us are here on Kaggle to try to improve our skill sets and become better Data Scientists. I personally have held mostly the same strategy since I started on Kaggle. I compete in competitions and then I look at the gold medal finishers  solutions with a fine tooth comb. My goal is to understand what led them to make the decisions nobody else saw. What did they do that I didn t think to try. For example  in this notebook  I get my first competition Gold medal. The core trick in this competition was refitting the model after some time had passed rather than only fitting the model at the time of submission. Check this notebook out and let me know what you think? What do you believe is the key to growth on Kaggle? I will also note  I put this post in the accomplishments category because I have heard that is where notebooks go now? If I am wrong about this let me know  Happy Kaggling	Best way to grow on Kaggle?		2024-03-24T21:37:16+00:00	14	cody11null	Grandmaster	gold	7	0	486421	accomplishments	['General']

Hello  Kaggle Community  I m happy to share a personal milestone. As 2024 started I vowed to help improve ML on tabular data  instead of getting lost in that LLM space . One of the way to do so was to build my own competition. The competition is available here The goal is to provide a good benchmark for tabular models  replicating the paper from  USER_leogri   URL  . I hope it will help improve models but also our understanding of those  black box  and what is driving their performance. Such a competition  accessible to the community helps fostering a spirit of collaboration and mutual growth. Key Highlights  so far      Competitions provides around 60 datasets    partitioned in 4 categories  whether data and or targets includes categoricals . I personally hope to see if we can get from data what is driving final performance.     Metric   is improvement over a baseline  an ensemble of catboost.   It has been on-ongoing for 2 months and   there is still more than one month to run  .   Discussion some interesting discussion about also on tabular data. Gbdts are by far the most used  because easier to use? .     Baseline   this discussion from  USER_carlmcbrideellis   URL  confirms initial findings. On untuned models x   Catboost   is best out of the box.   x Out of the box    Lgbm   is 20x faster while retaining most of the performance.  or conversely catboost is 20x times slower for slightly better performance - not sure that comparison is entirely fair to lgbm   x Out of the box    Xgboost    despite significant improvements in its 2.0 version is lagging behind both in terms of performance and training time.   Current Top solution achieves a   10  overall improvement in loss reduction  . I wonder what is going on.  I suspect some feature engineering .   Community also shared notebooks I personally would like to see more diverse baselines  notably on the NN side. The journey is not finished   First  the competition is still on-going. There is still a month to explore cutting edge technologies and make progress on the use of ML on tabular data. Feel free to participate  discuss  share insights. For this there is no better approach than participating   I also intend to update the competition with our main findings. Your feedback  questions  and insights will be taken into account.   I am also considering getting co-hosts. Feel free to reach out to me if you want to help  more specifically if you are willing to help gather more datasets   help on communication to improve participation. A huge thank you to everyone who has been a part of this project  directly or indirectly. Your support  encouragement  and constructive criticism have been the driving forces behind tabular ML progress. Let s continue to push the boundaries of what s possible together.

SUP Guys   Girls  I have lost in my solitary for many days now   thanks to school exams   exams are finally over and it s for some party    Just kidding some projects    I have done many competition on this great platform   but I think Kaggle lacks the most important part of machine learning which is surely   deployment     so I decided to deployment one of models from competition to IRL  IN Real life    it s most important bcoz  No Non-technical person generally wants look in your Jupyter notebook   They want final output  So here is the project.. I have the project done and now I had deployed it on streamlit instead here it the link churn bank  project   URL  Actually I also really excited to show see my project which based on this  Kaggle   URL  Competition ..   it is deployed using Streamlit  Tech Used-  Python  Jupyter Notebooks  Frontend  React Js   HTML   CSS  JSX I had deleted them all current version bcoz Streamlit does the job   you can see them in commits if you want to      Docker Also deleted current  tried to deploy on AWS EC2 Machine    And a lot of hard work and fun     And special thanks for Streamlit to provide such deployment facility for free and I had tried to deploy it on the Amazon Web Services  AWS   or Google Cloud or Microsoft Azure  but all them don t have empathy for a 16 year old student. from his home..  I mean they all ask for credit card information   I don t have it   forget it legally can t have my hands on Credit Card   Here is source code for nerd developers           Try give feedback if possible ??? I am really really happy as it s first project bcoz  first time is always the hardest time  Currently working on second one    if possible I will share that achievement also..

Hi Kagglers  It s been a month since I ve started to contribute to this community. And last week I finally became a Notebook Expert. This is a notable achievement for me  as I m a humble data enthusiast who hopes to learn something new while playing with data and not a professional. Thanks to all the members of Kaggle community who helped me in this journey. That was fun     . Coincidentally  the same week I ran my first Marathon race. So  now I m also a member of the not-so-big community of Marathon runners    0.5  of the population of Earth they say      . This has little to do with data science in general and Kaggle in particular. But I wanted to share. I m happy to be here and let s keep going         Fun  fun  fun  fun  fun	ð I'm a Kaggle Expert now, and ran my first ever Marathonð		2024-03-21T13:36:44+00:00	26	kidkoala	Expert	gold	26	0	485621	accomplishments	['Levels']

I m considering the organisation of a competition where  if the features  so not prediction targets  just features that I do want to give as inputs to models  ever become visible to the entrants  in their human form---not their models   this might give them sufficient information such that they could reproduce fairly accurate ground truth labels for the test data. It would require a huge amount of effort  but it would likely not be impossible. I suspect that turning the competition into a Code Competition might be the solution I need  because I understand that in this case I would not have to provide entrants with a downloadable  CODE  file. However  I am not sure if this also guarantees that they can never  at least  not before the end of the competition  see any of the test data features? Are entrants completely unable to observe any outputs of the notebooks they run at all? Can t they still just load the  CODE  file in their notebook  print the features  and observe those prints  for example?	Can code competitions be used to fully hide test data (including features) from entrants?		2024-02-07T13:12:50+00:00	1	dennissoemers	Contributor	bronze	3	0	475189	competition-hosting	['General']
So I study in a B School. Every term we have courses offered to us  each courses have limited seats  and each student has a total of 100 bid points available to them. Every term we have issues of irregular bids and students not getting subjects due to bad bid strategy. So what i want to build is a coded solution wherein my input will be the list of students  the preference of each student for the various courses  the list of courses with their maximum seats available. The output will be such that based on the above parameters i will predict the exact bid that each student should give so that they at least get their top 3 preferences. For eg the students can generally bid in the following manner - course1 - 35 points  course2-35 points  course3- 20 points  course4 - 10 points. I want to find a solution to this so that the headache is gone and students get what they want and optimal bids for each student for each subject can be predicted  Intermediate   discussions?tags 13103-Intermediate  Data Analytics   discussions?tags 13215-Data Analytics  Tabular   discussions?tags 14101-Tabula	Help needed with solving the B school bidding system	['Intermediate', 'Data Analytics', 'Tabular']	2024-02-27T17:50:33+00:00	-2	ahetesham	Novice		1	0	480209	competition-hosting	['Levels', 'Data Science']

One of the top requested features from competition hosts have been private competitions. With  last week   s updates   URL  you can now launch a truly private competition on Kaggle. Let   s dig into the settings that provide hosts granular control over who can see and access their competition.   Image of Privacy settings   URL   Figure Screenshot of the new settings       Competition Setup When you create a competition  you can now set the competition   s   Visibility   and select   Who Can Join   your competition. For competition   Visibility    there are two options  Public  and  Private . Public competitions are discoverable on Kaggle and appear in search results. Private competitions will not appear on Kaggle or in Kaggle search results. The setting   Who Can Join   controls how participants can join your competition. Selecting  Anyone   allows anyone on Kaggle to join your competition. Selecting  Only people with a link   restricts access to those that you   ve shared an invitation link with. Finally  a  Restricted email list  provides a way for hosts to specify domains or individual email addresses that can access a competition.      Participant Email Sharing You can also request that participants share their email address when they join. This provides a way for hosts to match kaggle usernames and submissions to email addresses - particularly useful for educators using Kaggle in the classroom.      Locking Down Data Finally  you can disable notebooks for your competition. This provides a way to ensure that any private data that you have in a competition is not accidentally leaked through shared notebooks. We re super excited about the new Participant and Host features  and we want to hear what you think. If you have any feedback or issues  please reply to this post.

I am the host of a competition that is held as part of a course at the university. This is the third year in a row that I am doing it. It seems that one of the new things introduced on Kaggle is that certain notebooks cannot be made public. There is a message  Making this notebook public will be locked until the competition ends.   and more info button is linked to  this page   URL  Is there a possibility to prevent this for a private competition  that is  that all notebooks can be made public? Namely  as part of the exercises for the faculty course  we have precisely defined tasks that students do  and after a certain deadline they must make their notebooks public. After that  students review each other s notebooks and score each other.  Without the possibility for all students to publish all notebooks publicly  within the competition   the learning concept we are promoting is not feasible.

It is pretty often that kagglers post some competition related questions or concerns. However  not that many hosts participate in these discussions leaving many things unclear. From my experience  the more supportive organizers are  the more successful competition is. For example  I find that competitions from  The Learning Agency Lab  are always fun  because organizers are happy to provide contestants with any additional information or materials. At the same time  ICR  for which we rarely saw any feedback from organizers  became another word for disaster and even today the competition page features a wrong evaluation formula. So why not that many hosts communicate with contestants? I hope the situation could be changed  as this would greatly improve quality and success of Kaggle competitions.

For a university course  our professor started a private competition and we created teams of 3. However  one of our teammates registered with the wrong email and deleted their account after joining our team. This led to us now having two students and 1 deleted user in our team with no possibility of adding the new account. Our professor tried to increase the team member limit to 4 but was unsuccessful. Our current solution is that the third participant will send us their files to post through our functional accounts. However  is their a way to fix the issue? Thanks in advance.

ChatGPT My demands are nothing less than an April Fool s Day Kaggle Competition        Designing an April Fool s Day Kaggle competition is quite a creative task  so let s dive into what that could entail. Given that it s for April Fool s  the competition could revolve around a humorous or unexpected twist on a typical data science problem. Here   s a concept outline   Title The Great AI Meme Classification Challenge    Objective Participants would develop models to accurately classify memes into various humor categories  but the twist is that some of the memes are intentionally mislabeled with absurd categories to keep in line with the spirit of April Fool s. The challenge would be to build a model that can discern the real categories from the fake ones.    Dataset A curated set of memes labeled with categories such as  Dad Joke    Pun    Satirical    Dark Humor   and fake categories like  Quantum Humor  or  Schrodinger s Cat Laugh .    Evaluation Models would be evaluated based on a multi-layer metric that first filters out the obviously mislabeled categories and then scores the classification on the legitimate categories.    Prize True to the April Fool s theme  the prize could be something humorous  like a virtual trophy or a meme created in the winner s honor.   Kaggle Page Elements Competition Description A humorous introduction that explains the real challenge is discerning the intentionally absurd from the genuinely funny. Data Description A detailed account of the meme dataset  with a caution that not all is as it seems. Evaluation Criteria Explanation of the two-tiered evaluation metric. Timeline A timeline that includes a  surprise  phase where additional  even more  ludicrous categories might be added. Discussion Forum Encouragement for participants to share the funniest misclassification their models make.     ChatGPT How can I create a dataset for an April Fool s themed Kaggle competition?       Creating a dataset for an April Fool s themed Kaggle competition  like the Great AI Meme Classification Challenge  involves several steps    1. Define the Scope and Rules Decide on the types of memes and humor categories you want to include  both real and fake. For April Fool s  consider categories that are broad enough to encourage creativity but specific enough to be recognizable.    2. Source the Memes Collect a large number of memes from various sources. This could be done manually or by writing scripts to scrape meme websites  ensuring you comply with their terms of service and copyright laws.    3. Annotate the Data You will need to annotate the memes with the correct humor categories. This task can be very subjective  so it s crucial to have clear guidelines. For the fake categories  you can get creative and tag memes with absurd labels that wouldn   t normally apply.    4. Create a Mislabeling Mechanism Since it s an April Fool s competition  introduce intentional mislabeling. You could either do this manually or develop an algorithm to randomly assign fake labels to a subset of the dataset.    5. Validate the Dataset Have a diverse group of individuals review a subset of the dataset to ensure the humor categories are appropriate and the fake labels are amusingly off-base.    6. Prepare for Release Once your dataset is ready  split it into training  validation  and testing sets. The test set should be kept hidden and only used for the final evaluation on Kaggle.    7. Document Everything Provide thorough documentation on the dataset  including the annotation guidelines  category descriptions  and the mislabeling process.    8. Legal and Ethical Review Ensure that the dataset adheres to legal and ethical standards. This includes respecting copyright  ensuring the content is not offensive  and obtaining necessary permissions if applicable.    9. Host the Dataset Choose a platform to host your dataset  such as Kaggle Datasets  GitHub  or a cloud storage service that Kaggle competitors can easily access.    10. Pilot Test Before launching  run a pilot test of your competition with a small group to iron out any potential issues.     What strategies can I use to promote an unconventional Kaggle competition to ensure high participation rates?       Promoting an unconventional Kaggle competition like an April Fool s themed event requires a mix of creativity  community engagement  and strategic marketing. Here are some strategies to consider    1. Leverage Social Media Use platforms like Twitter  LinkedIn  Reddit  especially subreddits related to machine learning and data science   and Facebook to spread the word. Create engaging content that highlights the unique aspects of your competition.    2. Kaggle Community Engagement Post in Kaggle forums to introduce your competition. Engage with the community by asking for feedback  offering tips  and updating them with any news related to the competition.    3. Blogging and Articles Write blog posts or articles explaining the competition s concept  the challenge it presents  and the potential learning opportunities for participants. Share these on Medium  Towards Data Science  Analytics Vidhya  and other data science-related platforms.    4. Collaboration with Influencers Reach out to influencers in the data science community and ask them to share information about your competition. They could be Kaggle Grandmasters  well-known data scientists  or educators in the field.    5. Email Campaigns If you have access to a mailing list of people interested in data science and machine learning  use it to announce the competition. Ensure the email is catchy  informative  and explains why this competition shouldn t be missed.    6. Promotional Videos Create a promotional video that can be shared on YouTube and other social platforms. The video should be entertaining  informative  and succinct  highlighting the fun nature of the competition.    7. Partner with Educational Institutions Contact universities and data science bootcamps to inform them about the competition. They can promote it among their students and faculty.    8. Offer Incentives Although the competition is humorous  offering incentives such as prizes  recognition  or opportunities for networking can increase interest. The prize doesn t have to be big  but it should be appealing.    9. Webinars and Workshops Host a webinar or workshop prior to the competition to explain the dataset  the challenge  and any unique aspects participants should consider. This can also serve as a Q A session.    10. Cross-Promotion on Platforms Use platforms like GitHub  Stack Overflow  or DataCamp  where you can reach out to communities that might be interested in such a competition.    11. Engage with Academia Share the competition with academic circles who may be interested in the computational humor aspect  which could inspire research or classroom projects.    12. Regular Updates Keep potential and registered participants engaged with regular updates  interesting insights about the competition progress  leaderboards  and highlight interesting solutions or approaches.     What are the best practices for data annotation in subjective categories like humor?        Annotating data for subjective categories such as humor requires careful consideration of the ambiguity and cultural differences inherent in such content. Here are some best practices to follow    1. Clear Guidelines Develop comprehensive guidelines that clearly define each humor category and provide examples. This helps to minimize the subjectivity as much as possible.    2. Diverse Annotation Team Recruit a diverse team of annotators with varying backgrounds to capture a wide range of perspectives on what might be considered humorous.    3. Training and Calibration Provide training for your annotators using a subset of your data. After training  have them annotate the same data independently and discuss discrepancies to calibrate their judgments.    4. Iterative Process Annotation should be an iterative process where annotators periodically review each other s work  discuss disagreements  and refine the guidelines based on emerging insights.    5. Multi-annotator Approach Use multiple annotators for each piece of content to reduce individual bias. The final category can be decided through majority vote  consensus  or calculating inter-annotator agreement.    6. Inter-annotator Agreement Regularly calculate inter-annotator agreement  e.g.  using Cohen s Kappa  to assess the consistency among annotators. Low agreement could indicate that the guidelines need clarification.    7. Pilot Annotations Conduct a pilot annotation with a small portion of the data. Use the insights gained to refine the annotation process before scaling up.    8. Feedback Mechanism Establish a feedback mechanism for annotators to communicate challenges and suggest improvements to the annotation process.    9. Handling Ambiguity For cases where annotators cannot agree  include an option to flag content as ambiguous. These cases can be reviewed separately or discussed in group sessions.    10. Ethical Considerations Ensure that the content is reviewed for potentially offensive material. Establish a protocol for handling sensitive or controversial humor.    11. Use of Annotation Tools Employ reliable annotation tools that allow for efficient tagging and reviewing of the content. These tools can also track changes and discussions among annotators.    12. Regular Review and Updates The humor can evolve over time  so it s essential to regularly review and update the categories and guidelines to reflect current trends and societal norms. For your prompting You ve asked a focused and relevant question that is crucial for ensuring the quality of a dataset  especially one that involves subjective judgment. For more detailed responses  you could inquire about specific methodologies for developing annotation guidelines or ask for case studies on similar tasks. Confidence Level High. These practices are commonly recommended for any subjective annotation task  ensuring reliability and validity in the annotated data. For future prompts  you could delve into how to automate parts of the annotation process using machine learning  or how to use the annotated data to train models in a way that accounts for its inherent subjectivity.

We have many Machine learning competitions which are being conducted online on Kaggle. The data for testing is divided into two parts i.e.  public and private  ratio of division may vary . When the code is  submitted  the kaggle scripts automatically test it on public and private data  the public LB is displayed and is useful  for participants to fine tune their ML models. However  after the deadline of the competition  the two or three submission selected will be tested on the  private data set. I observe the final results in these competitions is based on part of the data may be 50 -60 . The ML model is considered good if it can give good results on the entire data set. The final rankings are currently   just based on 50-60  data. My proposal is that for final LB  entire data set including public and private LB should be used so that   the best ML model is selected for prizes. Welcome suggestions and comments on my proposal.

I did not see yet examples of probabilistic models for regression. Such models predict targets not as scalars for given features  but as probability densities  assuming they depend continuously on features. Example a coin and two dice sets. Coin is flipped  depending on outcome either dice set is selected and rolled  the some of dice roll values is a target  so training records may look like   3 5 20  8 4 45  and so on. The right value is a target  the first two are dice quantities. The goal is to train model in such a way that it predicts probability density for provided features even if they were not part of training set. Also it should be done as black box  assuming no knowledge of underlying physical properties of the system.  I made one such model  here is video     I wonder  what are other competitive ways of building such models  besides Bayesian NN and k-NN and are such models in the interest of this site research.

Just wondering if it would be possible to do a Community Competition in the style of how March Madness is done.

Is it possible to have Community Competitions that do a re-score on a given date or by maybe by request from the host? There may be other forecasting type competitions that could find a scoring date after the submissions deadline useful  not sure if an option like that in host section could be possible?

Hello   I am looking into the possibility of hosting a competition on the platform and was wondering whether one can make a custom evaluation of images instead of csv files in a Community Competition.

Hi everyone  I hope you re doing well. I m considering hosting a competition on Kaggle and I would appreciate some guidance from those who have experience hosting competitions. I have a few questions What are some key factors to consider when deciding on the competition topic and dataset? Are there any specific criteria that make a dataset suitable for a Kaggle competition? How do you effectively engage participants and maintain their interest throughout the competition? Are there any strategies or best practices you recommend? What are the common pitfalls or challenges that hosts typically encounter? Are there any lessons learned or tips you can share to ensure a smooth competition experience? How should I structure the competition timeline? Are there any recommended durations for each phase  e.g.  data exploration  model building  submission ? Are there any additional resources or tools that you found particularly helpful as a competition host? Any advice or insights you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Hi. I have seen a lot of misguided attempts at creating a horse racing odds model  on here and elsewhere. The problem is the lack of quality data and domain knowledge  as I see it. I would like to bridge that gap  as I come into this with domain knowledge and unique racing data as my forte.. I have long given up making any money on this or becoming the new bill benter  so now I  m all about sharing and caring and having fun.  I have prepared something here   URL  including datasets  data descriptions  an intro  some inspiration from previous best efforts I ve come across  and also a Q A-session for asking me about anything related to the domain  horse racing and betting . I had planned to host a competition  but I realize that even that is a bit beyond my capabilities. Especially with the scoring part which I had forgot was an obvious demand.. Is it a foolish idea for a competition anyway  or should I try to find a way?

Hi Kagglers  We   re happy to announce a number of updates for competition hosts. These include UI updates to the   Overview Tab   and   Host Settings    as well as a new feature we   ve been calling   Private Competitions  .   These changes are rolling out gradually  so if you don   t see them now  you can expect to see them soon    ---    UI Updates We   ve updated the Overview tab ui to align with the larger design system we   re rolling out across Kaggle. The design should be familiar if you   ve used a dataset  notebook or model on Kaggle. The two-column design shows competition details in a main column  and meta-data on the right hand side. In the main column  a new overview section allows hosts to succinctly explain the details for a competition.   Image of an editable competition   URL  ---    Inline editing Competition hosts will now be able to edit competition contents and tags inline. Anywhere you see the Pencil icon is a place you can edit. Editing any of the sections opens up a markdown editor where you can edit and format content inline.   Image of editing form   URL  ---    Host tab The Host tab has also been updated to align with the Kaggle design system. This tab is where you   ll do the work to set up your competition - entering   Basic Details    adding   Images    adding   Hosts    setting your   Evaluation Metric    viewing   Teams   Submissions    and reviewing the   Launch Checklist  .   Image of Host Tab   URL  ---    Time-zone Support   Image of deadline settings   URL  If you   ve hosted a competition  you   ve probably done the mental math to convert UTC to your local timezone when setting the deadline. With today   s updates  the timezone defaults to your local time automatically. You can change this if you wish to. ---    Teams   Submissions   Image of Teams   Submissions   URL  We   ve also improved the way that Teams   Submissions are displayed. You should notice a faster load time for viewing teams  and an easier way to navigate their submissions. ---    Launch Checklist The Launch Checklist provides a workflow to your competition setup. It   s now organized by the work that you do when hosting a competition Content   Setup  Data  Evaluation   Testing  and Launch   Sharing.   Image of Launch Checklist   URL  Each section has the tasks laid out. A green checkmark tells you when you   ve completed a section. When you   re ready to launch  the bottom section will provide you a way to launch or schedule launch. ---    Private Competitions We ve also worked one of the top requested features from Community Competition hosts private competitions. Read more about private competitions in  this forum post   URL  ---     Feedback or Suggestions? We   re interested to hear about your experience with this change.

Dear kaggle  I have been running the same Community competition for a while now  BTW many thanks for the implementing the ability to clone Community competitions in a matter of seconds  . In my competition I made the usual assumption that the  CODE  column is not a feature  and from the very start in the sample notebook I provide I directly specify said column as the index column. Well today one of my students has discovered a   huge   data leak when actually using the aforementioned column as a feature  needless to say I was unaware of this leak beforehand . In kaggle competitions it has long been a bit of a sport to find the  magic  that directly results in a fantastic LB score. Well now I have a small dose of the feeling that the kaggle team must have when users actually  do  find the magic  the weird sinking feeling of the competition is broken  and nobody will now bother to try to solve it in the way intended  and the strong urge to nullify and restart the competition with the leak patched    TL DR I would just like to say a huge thanks to  USER_inversion   URL   USER_wcukierski   URL  and all the others on the competitions side for all the hard work over the years to create great competitions  competing in a competition is very hard  but creating a good robust competition is just as hard too.

The recent OTTO     Multi-Objective Recommender System competition has ended.  I observed some very novel solution ideas that i would like to try. This is what i want to do 1. Re implement some of the solution write ups. Combine and improve on them. 2. So I setup a community competition to re-host the dataset. 3. Invite kagglers to join. 4. Unlike the other kaggle competitions  this is mainly for learning. So we can discuss and share code  etc. 5. Personally  i want to stream live coding and have live Q A each week. you can think of this as a mass data science tutorial with some  leading the implementation  and other learns by following.  Different from the usual discussion forum  we have live interaction  kind of one-to-many tutor system. So in the end we would have repeated 1 solution each week  with detailed experiment analysis  etc      for two months And is there a legal or other issue to re-host the dataset?

Hello everyone  I hope you all are doing well. I wanted to take a moment to talk about the importance of weekly competitions on Kaggle s Playground. As you know  Kaggle provides a platform for learners and professionals alike to work on real-world problems and showcase their skills in data science and machine learning. One of the best ways to improve our skills and learn from others is through competitions. Recently  I have noticed that the Playground competitions on Kaggle have become a fortnightly event  which is less frequent than before. While I understand the need for change and optimization  I strongly believe that having weekly competitions is more beneficial for learners. Weekly competitions provide us with a consistent opportunity to practice our skills  learn new techniques  and get feedback from our peers. They also help us stay engaged with the Kaggle community and foster a sense of healthy competition. Therefore  I would like to request Kaggle to restore the weekly Playground competitions so that we can continue to learn and grow as data scientists. I encourage everyone to share their thoughts and support for this cause. Thank you for your time and happy learning	Importance of Weekly Competitions on Kaggle's Playground		2023-03-18T01:52:49+00:00	9	gauravduttakiit	Master	silver	10	0	395624	competition-hosting	['General']
Hello  My understanding is that the FScoreBetaMicro metric uses micro averaging for its calculation of precision and recall. However under the micro averaging scheme Precision   TP    TP   FP  Where TP   total true positive over all classes  FP   total False positive over all classes. Recall   TP     TP   FN   where FN   total false negatives over all classes. For a multiclass classifier  by definition FN   FP So with micro averaging precision   recall. Based on this for the Kaggle FScoreBetaMicro the value of beta will have no effect since precision and recall will always be the same as each other.

The accuracy metric of my competition is Categorization Accuracy. It requires  I guess  string Category and Id columns in solution.csv. So  it is a classic binary classification task  1 or 0 . And I don t know why  but If you try to load a solution file to my competition  which contains ONLY 1s or ONLY 0s you still will get 0 accuracy. You always get 0 accuracy in my comp. Why? Can you look at my data preparing code and say  what I am doing wrong?

Dear Kaggle  I try to finish setting up a competition  link at the end of the post  but I fail to complete the solution mapping step. I can successfully upload the solution file  select the columns for the mapping but things fail when clicking on the  Set solution mapping   Looking at the browser console  it pops      URL  I once though my solution file was too large  a 500MB csv  and reduced it down to 135MB with only 2M entries or so but it still fails.

We are a team of a few universities and we plan to launch a competition on Kaggle.  We are a bit stuck around the evaluation metric section  we understood that in the non-free plan you can use a custom evaluation metric.  Does this have any constraints? lets say I would want the users to submit a matrix as a solution instead of a row of predicted values  can something like that be achieved? Another question is regarding the leaderboard  can I provide multiple metric for each submission in the leaderboard?

Dear kaggle  At the moment the minimum resolution for the Competition Header Image should be at least 1900 x 400.   Finding creating such an image can be somewhat challenging. Also  the header image never occupies the full width of a standard monitor  the image seems to use only around 60  of the full width  so I think this requirement could perhaps be relaxed a little  to maybe even 1200 x 250?

However  we are facing difficulties in setting up the allowed submission formats and custom evaluation metrics. We know that Featured Competitions allow for custom evaluation metrics  but we are not sure how much flexibility there is in terms of allowing for customization. Specifically 1   We would like participants to submit their trained models  e.g.  .pt  .ckpt  rather than a single line of predictions.  2   We would like to build our own custom script to evaluate participants  trained models.

This is from  Intro to Programming course part 5  question 5  Question Say you re doing analytics for a website. You need to write a function that returns the percentage growth in the total number of users relative to a specified number of years ago. Your function percentage _growth   should take two arguments as input num _users   Python list with the total number of users each year. So num _users 0  is the total number of users in the first year  num _users 1  is the total number of users in the second year  and so on. The final entry in the list gives the total number of users in the most recently completed year.  yrs _ago   number of years to go back in time when calculating the growth percentage  For instance  say   num _users    920344  1043553  1204334  1458996  1503323  1593432  1623463  1843064  1930992  2001078 . if yrs _ago   1  we want the function to return a value of about 0.036. This corresponds to a percentage growth of approximately 3.6   calculated as  2001078 - 1930992  1930992. if years _ago   7  we would want to return approximately 0.66. This corresponds to a percentage growth of approximately 66   calculated as  2001078 - 1204334  1204334. Your coworker sent you a draft of a function  but it doesn t seem to be doing the correct calculation. Can you figure out what has gone wrong and make the needed changes?  CODE  1. So to calculate  you need to subtract the current user from the user from particular number of years ago right ?  can t we just do it by  user from years ago - current user   user from years ago   100 ? 2. What does the len   contribute here ? Why do we need it since we already have the number directly and we are not counting the length of something  right ? I am pretty new to this  so please correct me if I am wrong Thank you so much for the guidance	Please help me understand the question		2024-03-25T13:40:10+00:00	0	lalithaar	Novice		0	0	486554	getting-started	['Computer Science']

Hello  I am a complete beginner to the data science and programming world. I am learning python basics in YouTube right now and came across this community. I tried to do the courses in the learn section  but it seemed little difficult for me to understand - I just skimmed through the  Into to programming  course s first section and was able to answer the questions with no difficulty  but going further  I guess I get stuck mainly in actually understanding the question. Do you think I should build a foundation in my python skills before I do the courses or is it just about getting used to Kaggle s    Professional world s  style of wording ?

Introduction   The documentation of a project  process  user guide  or package is one way to ensure that everything that was planned has been implemented and is in place. A detailed document is not only essential for the end user but also for technical teams which need to refer to the document quite often. It is also one of the most boring  time-consuming activities but also the most important aspect of the project and a good investment for the future. A standard approach with the right kind of tools would go a long way in generating documents that are easy to use  search  navigate  and reuse. Python libraries like Sphinx and Mkdocs will let us generate these documents automatically from the code with no additional effort on documentation.      Overview of Sphinx   Sphinx is open source  written in Python  and was primarily built for Python documentation but it also supports a wide range of languages. Sphinx uses reStructuredText markup language by default which is specially designed for technical documentation. The easy-to-configure themes and extensions make it the most popular documentation library. Here is the snapshot of the document generated -  GitHub   URL       URL       Overview of MkDocs   MkDocs is a simple-to-use static site generator based on markdown. It is written in Python but is language-agnostic and a good choice of technical documentation where speed and simplicity are important. As it is a markdown  one can preview the content on the go. A good collection of themes and its easy customization make it a more attractive option for writing and building documentation. When coupled with mkdocstrings  it is a powerful tool for document generation from sources. Here is the snapshot of the document generated -  GitHub   URL       URL       Conclusion   There are various ways to document a project or package and everyone has their preference depending on the nature of the project and its complexity. We have explored and learned two most popular libraries in Python for auto-generated documents. Sphinx is the most popular and is widely used  most of the Python package documentation is built from Sphinx. The mkdocs  on the other hand  uses markdown  and I find it easier to configure and use. The combination of mkdocs and mkdocstrings would generate the same result as that of the sphinx. I highly recommend exploring and leveraging the power of both frameworks.

Hello Kagglers  A lot of freshers facing problem while building any project either you just create a popular problem project like Stocks price prediction or Dog cat classifier or copy paste from the youtube and a lot of time you may face your interviewers says that I have seen this project in many more candidate please show me some new one if you have this problem may be this article help   Choose your Domain this is the first step just choose your domain for which you want to create project there a lot of domain like Finance   Fashion   Education Tech  Marketing etc like I choose finance for that sake of article .   Deciding the problem this is the second step that which type of problem you wanna work on either it s a classification problem or regression problem then searching for a famous problem like in regression it is stock price prediction or cat dog classification the n using chatgpt writing a promp like  chatgpt suggest me some similar project ideas which are similar to stock price prediction and that is non clinchi in the resume    you can also write some fine prompt as you like so chatgpt provide you the idea and you can finalize it like I finalize smartphone price prediction 2024.   Choose your dataset This is the second step yet one of the important step how we can findout the dataset for our domain . These are a lot of platform to findout the right dataset for your project.  1. Kaggle 2.  UCI Machine Learning 3.  build your own custom data set 4.  Asking Perplexity AI a platform similar to chatgpt but more advance one. it will give you Kaggle link  Github link to your desire dataset.   Perform Data Analytics After finding your desire dataset you can perform Data Analytics  for performing Data Analytics you can prepare 10 critical question that hit your mind while seeing dataset . For example which is the highest price smartphone   which company have the lowest price range. like this you can think about it.   Create a blog on your Data Analytics Insights You can write a blog in the form of story telling about your Insights . A lot of you may be asked me that why I have to do this   so let me discuss some advantages for this.  1.  It increase your story telling ability as a lot of data role needs good story telling to their stack holders .  2.  You have lot of things to talk about in your interview   as a lot of you don t have a lot of things to discuss when it comes to interview.  3.  It increase your online presence.   Preparing A ML Model after the data analytics is done now it time to create a ML model from our dataset a lot of step involve in this like   1.  finding NULL values   2.  Handling Outliers  3.

It will also be helpful if people could share   entry level competitions   on Kaggle  to rapidly grow knowledge in the field and participate in active discussions.

Hi everyone  We are sharing a series of notebooks to help Kagglers to get started with the machine learning frameworks JAX and FLAX.   Intro to JAX    JAX   URL  is a framework which is used for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning research developed by  Google Research   URL  It allows you to build Python applications with a NumPy-consistent API that specializes in differentiating  vectorizing  parallelizing  and compiling to GPU TPU Just-In-Time. JAX was designed with performance and speed as a first priority  and is natively compatible with common machine learning accelerators such as  GPUs   URL  and  TPUs   URL  Large ML models can take ages to train -- you might be interested in using JAX for applications where speed and performance are particularly important    When to use JAX vs TensorFlow?    TensorFlow   URL  is a mature product  with a rich and fully-featured ecosystem  capable of supporting most every use case a machine learning practitioner might have  e.g.  TFLite   URL  for on-device inference computing   TFHub   URL  for sharing pre-trained models  and many additional specialized applications as well . This type of broad mandate both contrasts and compliments JAX s philosophy  which is more narrowly focused on speed and performance. We recommend using JAX in situations where you do want to maximize speed and performance but you do not require any of the long tail of features and additional functionalities that only the  TensorFlow ecosystem   URL  can provide.   Intro to FLAX   Just like  JAX   URL  focuses on speed  other members of the JAX ecosystem are encouraged to specialize as well. For example   Flax   URL  focuses on neural networks and  jgraph   URL  focuses on graph networks.  Flax   URL  is a JAX-based neural network library that was initially developed by Google Research s Brain Team  in close collaboration with the JAX team  but is now open source. If you want to train machine learning models on GPUs and TPUs at an accelerated speed  or if you have an ML project that might benefit from bringing together both  Autograd   URL  and  XLA   URL  consider using  Flax   URL  for your next project   Flax   URL  is especially well-suited for projects that use large language models  and is a popular choice for cutting-edge  machine learning research   URL    You can also use the JAX FLAX framework in your notebooks to make submissions for the  Google OSS Expert prize   URL  program.     How can I get started with JAX FLAX?   Here are some getting started notebooks on how to use JAX FLAX with different dataset formats for training machine learning models.    Digit Recognizer using JAX FLAX  Toy image dataset    URL     Dog Breed Classification using JAX FLAX  Image Dataset    URL     Jigsaw toxic comment classification using JAX FLAX  Text Dataset    URL     Cornell BirdCall classification using JAX FLAX  Audio dataset    URL  Likewise  this recently launched  community competition   URL  has both a large training dataset and a problem statement that benefits from fine-tuning a large language model -- it might be a great place to try out JAX as well    Disclaimer     We recommend using  GPUs   URL  when working with JAX on Kaggle.   These notebooks are compatible with the v3-8  TPUs   URL  that are provided for free in  Kaggle Notebooks   URL  but JAX was optimized for the newly updated  TPU VM   URL  architecture which is not yet available on Kaggle.

Lime Example    CODE    Sharp Example    CODE      Feature Visualization   This technique reveals which features are prioritized by the model  aiding in deciphering its focus.     Attention Mechanisms   Originally from the NLP world  show what parts of the input data are most influential in the model s decisions.     Model Simplification   Striving for simplicity  this approach attempts to make complex models more interpretable without significantly impacting their accuracy.     Interactive Visualization Tools   By enabling the dynamic exploration of how input modifications alter outputs  these tools offer hands-on insights into model behavior.    Trade-offs in Deep Learning Explainability     While seeking interpretability in deep learning  we encounter some trade-offs mentioned below     Accuracy vs. Explainability   Increasing a model s explainability can sometimes compromise its accuracy  a careful balance to maintain performance is essential.     Complexity of Interpretation Methods   Some interpretability techniques can be intricate  challenging their practical application.     Contextual Relevance   Explanations must resonate with domain-specific insights to be actionable and meaningful.    Resources for Further Learning      To delve deeper into the world of Explainable AI and interpretability in deep learning  check out the following resources    Interpretable Machine Learning  by Christoph Molnar   URL  A comprehensive guide to making machine learning models interpretable.

Hi Kagglers    Recently  Kaggle   URL  released a feature  schedule notebooks   URL  to schedule your notebooks to run automatically  . Using this  you can schedule your notebook to run daily weekly monthly and likewise any datasets that are created from scheduled notebook outputs can be set to automatically update whenever a new version of the notebook is saved. Furthermore  you can also schedule your notebooks to rerun whenever the datasets they are attached to get updated.     How do I use scheduled updates? 1. In the settings menu of the notebook editor  schedule the notebook to update either daily  weekly  monthly  or in response to the underlying dataset getting updated. 2. In the metadata section of a dataset that was created directly from a Kaggle Notebook Output File  select    Keep dataset in sync with new notebook versions   . Some limitations include   Only   CPU   notebooks can be scheduled  not GPU TPU .     5 Private   and   15 Public   notebooks can be scheduled at any given time.   Schedules expire after a   maximum   of   10 runs   after which they need to be reset.   For   dataset update triggers     scheduled notebooks run at most once per day.     Why do we need the scheduled updates? There are plenty of datasets which update on a daily or weekly or monthly basis  and previously notebooks depending on these datasets had to be re-run manually every time that the underlying datasets were updated. For example   the  USA COVID-19 Vaccinations   URL  dataset updates daily and notebook authors may want to schedule their notebooks to run every time that a new dataset version is published. Likewise  you can schedule notebooks to update on their own  even if they are not attached to any underlying datasets   URL    You can also use this feature to automatically re-run notebooks that create  maintain  and update new datasets as well  . For example  the  Reliance Stock Prices with News Sentiment        URL  dataset gets updated daily as a result of this  scheduled notebook   URL    fetching daily stock market data of Reliance and its daily news articles and creating a derived dataset which contains   news sentiment  . We can use this  generated dataset   URL  and study the stock market behavior and plan buy or sell strategies accordingly. Likewise  the  Kaggle Feedback Comments   URL  dataset gets updated daily as a result of  this scheduled notebook   URL   runs daily    which is taking    Feature Launch Update    forum posts from  meta-kaggle   URL  dataset   transforming it and creating a new  derived dataset   URL  from the notebook outputs and  this notebook   URL  analyzing kagglers reaction on feature launches updates forum posts   scheduled to run whenever the  Kaggle Feedback Comments   URL  dataset gets updated.     Community examples   Notebooks that are scheduled to re-run automatically in order to create  maintain  and keep updated a new or novel dataset                 Datasets that were created from the outputs of scheduled notebook runs           Notebooks that are scheduled to re-run automatically in order to maintain an always-up-to-date data visualization               Notebooks that are scheduled to update whenever a new version of the underlying dataset is published         URL	How to create a pipeline of scheduled and triggered notebooks		2021-12-07T10:37:35+00:00	577	yashvi	Master	gold	1018	528	293861	getting-started	['Hardware']
I am looking forward to start organizing my approach to data science. I find it that  depending on the topics  regression  classification  data exploration  etc      many of the tasks are following the same procedure  e.g. loading data  understanding it  dividing it  pre-processing it  feature engineering and selection    . I want to build a straightforward way to follow my notes  jump onto the parts that matter  and navigate them quite speedly and easily. Because this field uses jupyter notebooks extensively I started collecting my code snippets there  but I want to pick your brains and suggestions on how best to do this  I know these tens of lines of code will grow      . It feels jupyter notebooks aren t for this task  no hyperlinks to sections . Do you document your How-TO notes on jupyter notebooks? Word? Some other format allowing you to jump into subsections  like with an index  but editing these just as easily along the way? Do you fragment your info across multiple files  one for data exploration  another for models     . ?

In the field of artificial intelligence  this is most important step for any project in AI  ML  DL  NLP. Answering the simplest question    What is data preprocessing?     Processing the dataset in such a way that we could feed it to our model  so that our AI model learns best from dataset and helps in further predictions. An AI model  being complex  is a mathematical equation which understands numbers  built upon with many mathematical tools  concepts and genius ideas. Why data preprocessing?  Asking    Why    simplifies most of the learning process. Datasets in the real world are not that ideal to be directly feeded into a AI model. Simply assume as they are not ready. Lets take an example of titanic dataset.  Problem statement To build a predictive model that answers the question    What sorts of people were more likely to survive?    using passenger data.      URL  Now answer my questions 1  What can a AI model do with data like PassengerId  Name  Ticket number?  Answer Well the answer is very simple  AI model does nothing to with this data. Because these does not decide whether the person survives or not. 2  If you see    Cabin    column you could see some entries as    NaN   . It simply means that the value is missing. Now what my AI model should do since the value is missing ?  Answer Yes  the answer is to handle it. But my AI model don   t know how to handle it. Handling solely depends up on the use case. We should handle those in the preprocessing step. 3  Look at the columns    Sex        Embarked   . They are filled with characters  string  or may be some other unrelaible datatype. Does my AI model know how to use such data for predictions?  Answer Absolutely no  AI model is a mathematical equation. It understands the terms only of mathematical importance.  What   s the solution?  Convert the categorical columns to numerical columns. It is as simple as that. 4  If I have the dataset with less number of passengers like may be 200 or 300. Is it enough to train our AI model to help with further predictions?  The answer is that it depends. Usually we need a many datapoints to train our AI model. It also includes the step to artificially generate new datapoints. You will know about it if you follow me. And there are many aspects of feature engineering.      Major steps of Preprocessing 1. Load datasets and decide which columns not at all required for our use case. Drop them from dataset. I call this step as    Feature selection 1   . 2. Determine the numerical columns and categorical columns. 3. Exploratory data analysis is most important step of preprocessing. I call this step as    Know more about your dataset   . 4. Handle missing values by imputing mean  median  mode or any other value in place of    NaN   . 5. Upsample the dataset if it is unbalanced. Artificially generate more datapoints if needed. 6. Encode all the categorical features with the techniques like nominal encoding  ordinal encoding  target guided encoding. 7. Feature selection 2 Remove the features on the basis of variance  correlation and there are many more methods. 8. Finally scale the dataset. The dataset is now ready to be feeded to AI Model. Actually there may be some steps included in between. I have discussed the major steps. Exactly what to do in preprocessing depends on project to project and how well you have done EDA.      Key takeaways Understand what is Preprocessing?  Major steps of Preprocessing.  You had tried to think about the answers of the questions I have asked.

I have a notebook where I m running a model on different CSVs. Since there are a lot of CSVs  I end up exceeding the 12 hour limit on commit and run  so I run the notebook on different pairs of CSV every time. This way I generate a version of the model for every CSV. I tried creating a dataset from the output but on the next run I only have the option of updating actually replacing  the previous dataset s contents with the new run.

URL  I just finished the first chapter of the book  Feature Engineering for Machine Learning Principles and Techniques for Data Scientists   and I would like to discuss some thoughts I had along the way. I usually create a function 1  to test a handful of models  or even apply auto-ml. When evaluating the score on both training and test data  we can infer a series of things  let s focus on the fact that the features chosen for the problem may simply not have much impact. This is a problem if you re thinking in a data-centric analysis  however  I prefer to take this first step because I understand that if the score doesn t surpass a mere guess  50    it leads me to believe that the features I have at hand do not reflect the nature of my problem  that is  they are inadequate . Therefore  I return to the step of selecting features and apply methods such as binning  PCA    and all sorts of other strategies that I continue to learn more about. After this stage  I use random search and then grid search to save resources  first I test a sampling  select  and then test all possible ones . This process makes me proud to know that despite the mistakes  I am beginning to understand machine learning  although it may seem obvious  I believe it is a lifelong work  isn t it? It s not about models  I would say. It s about interaction  testing  reformulation  and organization so that tests are possible and controlled  like a backlog . I conclude by saying that  not knowing where to start  first understand your problem  in competitions  using other people s notebooks is something I value highly on the platform   then using a framework that allows you to interact with the data  add a feature selection step  and then start your work in earnest. ---    Resources  1  Framework for testing the models  CODE   2  Resources I read to write   Data-Centric Approach vs Model-Centric Approach in Machine Learning   URL   Feature Selection Methods and How to Choose Them   URL  --- Thank you for coming this far. The opinion above solely reflects my perspective on what I have studied  without any intention of establishing absolute truths. As part of the learning process  I acknowledge the risk of making mistakes  but at the moment  I am confident in my words   . I strongly recommend reading the mentioned book. Reading is my superpower  I usually read hundreds of books per year and have frameworks that help me keep relevant information in one place where I can grasp the book s idea in seconds. I ll still talk about this because I consider that the most positive aspect of a library  as Humberto Eco well said  is the unread books  conversation for another time . Finally  I hate anything that borders on self-help  and I don t always read fiction despite having my favorites.
